0,Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives.
0,Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.
0,Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins.
0,"In the process, they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make."
0,This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions.
0,"After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book."
0,Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.
0,"Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand."
0,The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round.
0,"Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player’s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa."
0,"Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands."
0,"If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up exhausted and be forced to retreat."
1,"Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game."
1,"At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand."
1,"During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station)."
1,Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.
1,"After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards."
1,"These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further."
1,"Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to."
1,"Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives."
1,"If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month."
1,"If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards."
1,"During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced."
1,"These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components."
1,"Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects."
1,"A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play."
1,Part of the Pandemic series
2,"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass."
2,"Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870."
2,"As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands."
2,"Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):
1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile."
2,"2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network."
2,3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.
2,"4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery."
2,5) Loan - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income.
2,"Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:
6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card."
2,(This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)
2,The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870).
2,"To win the game, score the most VPs."
2,"VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles."
2,Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails.
2,"Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs."
2,"This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement."
2,"Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham."
2,"New ""Sell"" system
Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham."
2,You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board.
2,Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game.
2,"To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also ""grease the wheels of industry"" by consuming beer."
2,"For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip."
2,"As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer."
2,"Birmingham features three all-new industry types:
Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods."
2,"Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels."
2,"Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton."
2,"Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan."
2,"Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon."
2,Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass.
2,It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.
3,Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven.
3,"The game includes four new characters — Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) — that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game."
3,The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city.
3,"Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?"
3,Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly.
3,"All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario."
3,"The last barrier to entry — i.e., learning the game — has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience."
4,"In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars."
4,"Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable."
4,"In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things."
4,The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand.
4,"The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere."
4,"The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources."
4,"Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough."
4,"Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project)."
4,Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.
4,"Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters."
4,"However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources."
4,"Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat."
4,"On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles."
4,You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs.
4,"Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:
1) Player order shifts clockwise."
4,2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.
4,"3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play."
4,The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.
4,4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.
4,"When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation."
4,Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning corporation!
5,"Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining."
5,"Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics."
5,"These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy."
5,No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical.
5,"At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts."
5,"Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board."
5,An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes.
5,The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.
5,A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round.
5,These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy.
5,"After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions."
5,"At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways."
5,"After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them."
5,"Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round."
5,"Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective."
5,These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system.
5,"At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective."
5,"As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game."
5,Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.

6,"In Ark Nova, you will plan and design a modern, scientifically managed zoo."
6,"With the ultimate goal of owning the most successful zoological establishment, you will build enclosures, accommodate animals, and support conservation projects all over the world."
6,Specialists and unique buildings will help you in achieving this goal.
6,"Each player has a set of five action cards to manage their gameplay, and the power of an action is determined by the slot the card currently occupies."
6,"The cards in question are:

CARDS: Allows you to gain new zoo cards (animals, sponsors, and conservation project cards)."
6,"BUILD: Allows you to build standard or special enclosures, kiosks, and pavilions."
6,ANIMALS: Allows you to accommodate animals in your zoo.
6,ASSOCIATION: Allows your association workers to carry out different tasks.
6,SPONSORS: Allows you to play a sponsor card in your zoo or to raise money.
6,"255 cards featuring animals, specialists, special enclosures, and conservation projects, each with a special ability, are at the heart of Ark Nova."
6,Use them to increase the appeal and scientific reputation of your zoo and collect conservation points.

7,Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.
7,Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before.
7,"In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance."
7,"You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause."
7,"Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:

 As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star."
7,"You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will."
7,"To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it."
7,"Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them."
7,"As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons."
7,"However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military."
7,"In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence."
7,"To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause."
7,"If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win."
7,"Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it."
7,"Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic."
7,"As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine."
7,"As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy."
7,You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!
8,Gaia Project is a new game in the line of Terra Mystica.
8,"As in the original Terra Mystica, fourteen different factions live on seven different kinds of planets, and each faction is bound to their own home planets, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring planets into their home environments in competition with the other groups."
8,"In addition, Gaia planets can be used by all factions for colonization, and Transdimensional planets can be changed into Gaia planets."
8,"All factions can improve their skills in six different areas of development — Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaiaforming, Economy, Research — leading to advanced technology and special bonuses."
8,"To do all of that, each group has special skills and abilities."
8,"The playing area is made of ten sectors, allowing a variable set-up and thus an even bigger replay value than its predecessor Terra Mystica."
8,A two-player game is hosted on seven sectors.

9,"In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing."
9,"As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there."
9,Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders.
9,"Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers."
9,"Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so."
9,Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects.
9,"Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively."
9,"In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island."
9,The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion.
9,"Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities."
9,"The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present."
9,"The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped."
9,"Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight."
9,"The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts."
9,Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.
9,"At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain."
9,"Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory."
9,"The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony)."
9,"Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill."
10,"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA)."
10,"Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not."
10,"The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa."
10,"But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring."
10,"Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring."
10,"But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest."
10,Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn.
10,"Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track)."
10,Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards.
10,Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play.
10,"Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle."
11,"Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization is the new edition of Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, with many changes small and large to the game's cards over its three ages and extensive changes to how military works."
11,Through the Ages is a civilization building game.
11,"Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military."
11,Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents.
11,The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.
11,One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting.
11,"Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play."
11,"In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it."
11,While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military.
11,Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings.
11,Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players.
11,"There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture."
11,"It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one."
11,Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.
12,"America in the 19th century: You are a rancher and repeatedly herd your cattle from Texas to Kansas City, where you send them off by train."
12,This earns you money and victory points.
12,"Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow."
12,"However, the ""Great Western Trail"" not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail."
12,"Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line."
12,"If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game."
12,—description from the publisher
13,"""Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are – but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...""
– John F. Kennedy
In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire."
13,"Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two."
13,The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened.
13,"Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors."
13,"Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States."
13,The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life.
13,"The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new ""superpowers"" scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing."
13,Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage.
13,"It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition."
13,"The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower."
13,"As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?"
13,Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game.
13,"They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation."
13,"Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war."

14,"Some important links: The Official FAQ, the Unofficial FAQ, and an Automa (solo and 2p) Overview
Dune: Imperium is a game that finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson."
14,"As a leader of one of the Great Houses of the Landsraad, raise your banner and marshal your forces and spies."
14,"War is coming, and at the center of the conflict is Arrakis – Dune, the desert planet."
14,Dune: Imperium uses deck-building to add a hidden-information angle to traditional worker placement.
14,"You start with a unique leader card, as well as a deck identical to those of your opponents."
14,"As you acquire cards and build your deck, your choices will define your strengths and weaknesses."
14,"Cards allow you to send your Agents to certain spaces on the game board, so how your deck evolves affects your strategy."
14,"You might become more powerful militarily, able to deploy more troops than your opponents."
14,"Or you might acquire cards that give you an edge with the four political factions represented in the game: the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen."
14,"Unlike many deck-building games, you don’t play your entire hand in one turn."
14,"Instead, you draw a hand of cards at the start of every round and alternate with other players, taking one Agent turn at a time (playing one card to send one of your Agents to the game board)."
14,"When it’s your turn and you have no more Agents to place, you’ll take a Reveal turn, revealing the rest of your cards, which will provide Persuasion and Swords."
14,"Persuasion is used to acquire more cards, and Swords help your troops fight for the current round’s rewards as shown on the revealed Conflict card."
14,"Defeat your rivals in combat, shrewdly navigate the political factions, and acquire precious cards."
14,The Spice must flow to lead your House to victory!
15,It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa.
15,The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow.
15,"The capitalistic city-state known simply as “The Factory”, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries."
15,Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period.
15,"It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor."
15,"In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory."
15,"Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs."
15,"Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal."
15,Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction’s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).
15,Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate.
15,"Other than each player’s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are “encounter” cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands."
15,"Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection."
15,"Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness."
15,Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns.
15,"While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination."
15,Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it.
15,"Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources."
15,These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game.
15,"The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times."
16,The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France.
16,"Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom."
16,"While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers."
16,The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board.
16,Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom.
16,"The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile."
16,"The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds."
16,Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.
16,"At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die."
16,A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.
16,During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.
16,"During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice."
16,In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.
16,"If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded."
16,"Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points."
16,Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.
16,The game ends after the fifth phase is played to completion.
16,"Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods."
16,Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.
16,The player with the most victory points wins.
16,The rules include basic and advanced versions.
16,This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.
16,There is a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.
16,"The 2019 edition includes, alongside the base game, eight expansions, seven of which had already been released separately as promotional items and one new to the 2019 release."
17,Playing Nemesis will take you into the heart of sci-fi survival horror in all its terror.
17,"A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance."
17,A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab.
17,A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment.
17,Intruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by.
17,"The longer the game takes, the stronger they become."
17,"During the game, you control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment."
17,These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs.
17,"For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat."
17,"The soldier, on the other hand..."
17,Nemesis is a semi-cooperative game in which you and your crewmates must survive on a ship infested with hostile organisms.
17,"To win the game, you have to complete one of the two objectives dealt to you at the start of the game and get back to Earth in one piece."
17,"You will find many obstacles on your way: swarms of Intruders (the name given to the alien organisms by the ship AI), the poor physical condition of the ship, agendas held by your fellow players, and sometimes just cruel fate."
17,"The gameplay of Nemesis is designed to be full of climactic moments which, hopefully, you will find rewarding even when your best plans are ruined and your character meets a terrible fate."
18,In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.
18,"What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round."
18,"A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately."
18,"As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder."
18,"Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability."
18,"Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short."
18,"Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area."
18,"A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins."
19,Brass: Lancashire — first published as Brass — is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution.
19,"You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton."
19,The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase.
19,"To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half."
19,"VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles."
19,"Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:

Build an industry tile
Build a rail or canal
Develop an industry
Sell cotton
Take a loan

At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck."
19,"Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent."
19,"This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns."
19,"After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences."
19,"After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins."
19,"During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible."
19,"At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned."
19,"The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions."
19,This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards.
19,"Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized)."
19,"Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:

 The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been made optional."
19,The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck and distant market tiles slightly to ensure a consistent experience.
19,Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.
19,The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.
20,"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea."
20,"With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities."
20,Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor — all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!
20,Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up.
20,"Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities."
20,Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them!
20,"In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth."
20,Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game.
20,"These cards serve two purposes:

They allow a player to choose actions during the game."
20,They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.
20,Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves.
20,"Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities."
20,"(One side of the game board shows the entire Roman Empire with 30 cities for 3-5 players, while the other shows Roman Italy with 25 cities for 2-4 players.)"
20,"When all cards have been sold or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends."
20,"The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, etc.)"
20,wins the game.
21,A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game.
21,"You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today — a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium."
21,"When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking."
21,"Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates."
21,They were explorers and founders of states.
21,"Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus."
21,"In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans."
21,One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066.
21,He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England.
21,The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation.
21,Crop shortfalls caused great distress.
21,"In this game, you will raid and explore new territories."
21,You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society.
21,"In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner."
21,"--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:
A Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risk balanced against reward."
21,"A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles."
21,"Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own."
21,"Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast."
21,The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair.
21,"You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from."
21,Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns.
21,"Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful."
21,"At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter."
21,You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall.
21,"The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those."
21,"You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation."
21,"It all comes down to how much you’re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you’re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards."
22,"In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups."
22,"Terra Mystica is a full information game, without any luck, that rewards strategic planning."
22,Each player governs one of the 14 groups.
22,"With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills."
22,There are also four religious cults in which you can progress.
22,"To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities."
22,"Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal."
22,Different buildings allow players to develop different resources.
22,Dwellings allow for more workers.
22,Trading houses allow players to make money.
22,"Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills."
22,Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary.
22,Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers.
22,"The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:

Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)
Plains (Halflings, Cultists)
Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)
Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)
Forest (Witches, Auren)
Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)
Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)

Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica."
22,"Being close to other groups gives you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficult...

27,"Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together."
27,This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats.
27,"In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths."
27,"Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods."
27,"Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright."

28,"In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards."
28,"They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers."
28,They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.
28,The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year.
28,"Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter."
28,"There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers."
28,"Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them."
28,Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.
28,"Using those workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany."
28,"Viticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas & Papas, Fields (previously known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo variant, along with a few minor rule changes."

29,Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?
29,Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.
29,"On their turn a player can take one of three actions:
a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces."

29,"Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions."
29,b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards.
29,"There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity."
29,"Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points."
29,The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.
29,c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added.
29,"The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins."

30,"You will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory."
30,The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy.

31,"In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island."
31,"Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential."
31,"You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now?"
31,And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!?

33,Food Chain Magnate is a heavy strategy game about building a fast food chain.
33,The focus is on building your company using a card-driven (human) resource management system.

33,The game can be played by 2-5 serious gamers in 2-4 hours.
34,"In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico."
34,The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.
34,"Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources."
34,"Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons."
34,The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons.
34,"Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities."
34,Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.
34,"During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as ""Trader"" or ""Builder"")."
34,"When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role."
34,"The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the ""Builder"" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn."
34,"Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it."
34,This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.
34,"Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a ""governor"" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn."
34,The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.
34,"Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned ""large buildings."""
34,Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five.
34,This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player.
34,Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player.
34,"As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game."
34,"In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles."
34,"These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico."
34,"Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players."

36,"In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers."
36,"Barrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses."
36,"Each player represents one of the four international companies who are gathering machinery, innovative patents and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to collect and exploit the water of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers."
36,Barrage includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms.
36,"First, the players must carefully plan their actions and handle their machinery, since both their action tokens and resources are stored on a Construction Wheel and will only be available after a full turn of the wheel."
36,"The better you manage your wheel, the earlier your resources and actions come back to you."
36,"Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource."
36,"Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches the downstream dams), raise the dams to increase their capacity, and build long tunnels to channel the water to their powerhouses."
36,"Water is never consumed — its flow is just used to produce energy —, it is instead released back to the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover the water diverted by you and the other players."
36,"Over five rounds, the players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts."
36,"At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to enhance their machinery to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique-effect buildings to forward their own developing strategy."
37,Too Many Bones comes loaded for bear by breaking into a new genre: the dice-builder RPG.
37,This game takes everything you think you know about dice-rolling and turns it on its head.
37,"Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous ""baddie"" responsible."
37,Team up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign.
37,"With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out."
37,Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win.
37,"Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect!"
37,"Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue!"
37,"The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle."
38,"Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming."
38,"In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains."
38,"You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn."
38,"Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain."
38,You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.
38,It's up to you how much ore you want to mine.
38,You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions.
38,"While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth."
38,"Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals."
38,You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm.
38,"In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins."
38,You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.
38,"Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources."
38,"Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies."
38,The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.
39,"""Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL""
In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan’s warriors, leader, and ship."
39,"Ragnarök has come, and it’s the end of the world!"
39,It’s the Vikings’ last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin’s side!
39,For a Viking there are many pathways to glory.
39,"You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarök, the ultimate inescapable doom."
39,Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages).
39,"These “Gods’ Gifts” grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology."
39,"They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla."
39,"Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support."
39,"For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner."
39,"Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents’ strategies as the action phase unfolds."
39,"Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret."
39,"By observing your opponent’s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly."
39,"Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed."
39,The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!
40,"Description from BoardgameNews
In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else."
40,"On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on."
40,"You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house."
40,And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
40,"The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations."
40,"In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all."
40,"For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof."
40,Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.
40,Agricola is a turn-based game.
40,"There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14)."
40,"Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round."
40,"There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over."
40,"Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference."
40,Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy.
40,"Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand."
40,"Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions..."
41,"In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire."
41,"Western histories often call this period ""The Great Game"" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries."
41,"In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes."
41,"In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder."
41,"Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court."
41,Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game.
41,That last point is worth emphasizing.
41,"Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly."
41,"To survive, players will organize into coalitions."
41,"Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a ""Dominance Check"", is resolved."
41,"If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition."
41,"However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base."
41,"After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions."
41,The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.
42,"In Underwater Cities, which takes about 30-45 minutes per player, players represent the most powerful brains in the world, brains nominated due to the overpopulation of Earth to establish the best and most livable underwater areas possible."
42,The main principle of the game is card placement.
42,"Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board  into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored."
42,Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color.
42,Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card.
42,"Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's ""A-cards""; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay."
42,All of the nearly 220 cards — whether special or basic — are divided into five types according to the way and time of use.
42,"Underwater areas are planned to be double-sided, giving players many opportunities to achieve VPs and finally win."
43,"Maracaibo, the new strategy game for 1-4 players by Alexander Pfister, is set in the Caribbean during the 17th century."
43,The players try to increase their influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player.
43,"The players sail on a round course through the Caribbean, e.g., you have city tiles where you are able to perform various actions or deliver goods to."
43,"One special feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the player, who chase after it, a little story."
43,"As a player, you move with your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from Alexander Pfister."
43,NOTE: The Spanish version of Maracaibo contains La Armada mini-expansion packaged inside the base game's box.
44,"Description from the publisher:
The world almost ended 71 years ago..."
44,The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world.
44,Most died within a week.
44,Nothing could stop it.
44,The world did its best.
44,It wasn't good enough.
44,"For three generations, we, the last fragments of humanity have lived on the seas, on floating stations called ""havens."""
44,"Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely."
44,We've managed to keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive.
44,Things have been tough the past few years.
44,Cities far away from the havens have fallen off our grid...
44,"Tomorrow, a small group of us head out into what's left of the world."
44,We don't know what we'll find.
44,Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 is an epic cooperative game for 2 to 4 players.
44,"Unlike most other games, this one is working against you."
44,"What's more, some of the actions you take in Pandemic Legacy will carry over to future games."
44,No two worlds will ever be alike!
44,Part of the Pandemic series.
45,It is the late 26th century.
45,Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions.
45,"The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation."
45,"Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other."
45,"Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital."
45,"By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past."
45,"Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum."
45,"But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth."
45,"Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...
Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system."
45,"To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them — and both are in short supply."
45,"The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs — unless, of course, it is averted!"
45,The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline.
45,"By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past ""self"" with resources."
45,Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved.
45,"The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not."
45,"Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet..."
46,"Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a fully co-operative, app-driven board game of horror and mystery for one to five players that takes place in the same universe as Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign."
46,Let the immersive app guide you through the veiled streets of Innsmouth and the haunted corridors of Arkham's cursed mansions as you search for answers and respite.
46,"Eight brave investigators stand ready to confront four scenarios of fear and mystery, collecting weapons, tools, and information, solving complex puzzles, and fighting monsters, insanity, and death."
46,Open the door and step inside these hair-raising Mansions of Madness: Second Edition.
46,It will take more than just survival to conquer the evils terrorizing this town.
47,"In the co-operative trick-taking game The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine, the players set out as astronauts on an uncertain space adventure."
47,What are the rumors regarding the unknown planet about?
47,The eventful journey through space extends over 50 exciting missions.
47,But this game can only be defeated by meeting common individual tasks of each player.
47,In order to meet the varied challenges communication is essential in the team.
47,But this is more difficult than expected in space.
47,With each mission the game becomes more difficult.
47,After each mission the game can be paused and continued later.
47,During each mission it is not the number of tricks but the right tricks at the right time that count.
47,The team completes a mission only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks.
47,"The game comes with 50 missions, with three additional missions published in spielbox 2/2020."
48,Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement.
48,"Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots."
48,"During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers."
48,"When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game."
48,"When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker."
48,"Actions located ""later"" on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you – but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up."
48,The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear.
48,There are many paths to victory.
48,Pleasing the gods by placing crystal skulls in deep caves or building many temples are just two of those many paths...
49,"Following the success of unmanned rover missions, the United Nations established the Department of Operations and Mars Exploration (D.O.M.E.)."
49,"The first settlers arrived on Mars in the year 2037 and in the decades after establishment Mars Base Camp, private exploration companies began work on the creation of a self-sustaining colony."
49,"As chief astronaut for one of these enterprises, you want to be a pioneer in the development of the biggest, most advanced colony on Mars by achieving both D.O.M.E."
49,mission goals as well as your company’s private agenda.
49,"In the beginning, you will be dependent on supplies from Earth and will have to travel often between the Mars Space Station and the planet's surface."
49,"As the colony expands over time, you will shift your activities to construct mines, power generators, water extractors, greenhouses, oxygen factories, and shelters."
49,Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization.
49,"This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food — the necessities for survival."
49,Do you dare take part in humankind’s biggest challenge?
49,"On Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase ​and the Shuttle Phase​."
49,"During the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions."
49,The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on.
49,"If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse."
49,"If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet’s surface with your rover."
49,"In the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit."
49,All buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow.
49,Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists.
49,Upgrading the colony’s ability to provide each of these resources is vital.
49,"As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars."
49,"During the game, players are also trying to complete missions."
49,"Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends."
49,"To win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars."
49,This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP).
49,The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner.
50,Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag.
50,"It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence."
50,The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.
50,"In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities."
50,"However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment."
50,"Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes."
50,Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!
50,Many questions are asked over and over in the forums...
50,"If you have a question about a specific expansion, please check the rules forum or FAQ for that particular expansion."
51,Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland.
51,"At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export."
51,"In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth."
51,Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance.
51,More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe.
51,"Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky!"
51,The game ends after five rounds.
51,"Each round consists of the three phases:
1."
51,"Players' turns
2."
51,"Production phase
3."
51,"Round scoring
1."
51,"Players take turns and do one of eight possible actions, from building, to upgrading, trading and exporting."
51,"When players run out of money, they pass and collect a passing bonus."
51,2.
51,"In the production phase, each player collects basic resources, refined goods and cash from their production units built on the game map."
51,Each production unit built makes income visible on the player mat.
51,Refined goods require the respective basic resource.
51,3.
51,Players receive VPs depending on the scoring tile of the current round.
51,"The game comes with eight different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, eight port bonuses and eight round scoring tiles."
52,"In Le Havre, a player's turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action."
52,"As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings."
52,"Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships."
52,"Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own."
52,"Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers."
52,"After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers."
52,"After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends."
52,Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves.
52,The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.
53,"In the trick-taking card game The Crew: Mission Deep Sea, you and the other players work together to search for the lost continent of Mu."
53,This new adventure takes your crew deep down into the abyss on a search for the fabled sunken land.
53,How far you get depends entirely on how well you work together as a team.
53,"Card by card, trick by trick, your search party will discover the challenges that lie ahead and forge a path to Mu."
53,This new version of The Crew has the same innovative co-operative trick-taking mechanism as the highly lauded original game — but with some exciting new surprises!
53,"While communication between your crew members is severely limited by your submerged state, it is also critical to your success; finding the hidden land in the murky depths depends not only on winning tricks, but also on carefully negotiating the order in which they are won."
53,"If things don't go as planned, you might just be able to salvage the operation, but it will take near flawless execution and perhaps a little luck to finally reach Mu."

55,Imperial Assault puts you in the midst of the Galactic Civil War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star over Yavin 4.
55,"In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games."
55,"The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empire’s hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives."

56,There also appears to be some large object trying to get out of that sealed box...
57,Crokinole is a dexterity traditional game.
57,"Crokinole is played on a circular wooden board, with wooden circular disks as playing pieces."
57,Players take turns shooting disks across the circular wooden board by flicking the disks with their fingers.
57,"Players try to land their disks in scoring regions on the board, with the highest scoring area the recessed hole in the very center of the board."
57,"Each round, each player/side alternately shoots a set number of disks (usually 12 or 8), shooting one disk each turn."
57,"As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship."
57,"Players must position their disk on the start of each of their turns in their quadrant in front of them, touching the outer scoring ring boundary."
57,"If there are no opponent's disks on the board, they must aim for the center of the board."
57,"If there is an opponent's disk on the board, they must aim and hit an opponent's piece first, either directly, or by a carrom shot."
57,"The center recessed hole is worth 20 points, and disks are removed and scored at the end of the round if they land in the center hole."
57,"Disks that are outside the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, or are touching the outer scoring ring at the end of each shot, are removed from play for the round."
57,Scoring is by cancellation scoring (e.g.
57,"Player/Side One scores 250, and Player/Side Two scores 225, Player/Side One scores 25.)"
57,It is usually played as a two-player game or as a four-player game with partners.
57,"Play is to a set score, usually the first player/side to 100."
57,"Alternately, play is set at ""Match Scoring"" where the winner of each round scores 2 points, and if a tie, each player scores 1 point."
57,"A ""game"" is usually played to four rounds, with the winner of each ""game"" being the one with the most points."
57,"The numbers of ""games"" in a match is set by the tournament."
57,"The World Crokinole Championship uses ""Match Scoring."""
58,"In The Quacks of Quedlinburg, players are charlatans — or quack doctors — each making their own secret brew by adding ingredients one at a time."
58,"Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!"
58,Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips.
58,"During each round, they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their pots."
58,"The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the pot's swirling pattern, increasing how much the potion will be worth."
58,"Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot will explode!"
58,"At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients, depending on how well they managed to fill up their pots."
58,But players whose pots have exploded must choose points or coins — not both!
58,The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.

60,"The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city."
60,"You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs."
60,Lisboa is played on a real map of downtown Lisbon.
60,"During the planning of the downtown project, the type of business permitted in each street was previously determined."
60,"The economic motor is driven by the wealth of the royal treasure and this treasure is controlled by player actions during the game, making each game a totally different experience."

62,—description from the publisher
63,It's the early 20th century.
63,You have decided to sail back to the newly discovered seventh continent to attempt to lift the terrible curse that has struck you since your return from the previous expedition.
63,"In The 7th Continent, a solo or cooperative ""choose-your-own-adventure"" exploration board game, you choose a character and begin your adventure on your own or with a team of other explorers."
63,"Inspired by the Fighting Fantasy book series, you will discover the extent of this wild new land through a variety of terrain and event cards."
63,"In a land fraught with danger and wonders, you have to use every ounce of wit and cunning to survive, crafting tools, weapons, and shelter to ensure your survival."
63,"Unlike most board games, it will take you many, MANY hours of exploring and searching the seventh continent until you eventually discover how to remove the curse(s)...or die trying."
63,"The 7th Continent features an easy saving system so that you can stop playing at any time and resume your adventure later on, just like in a video game!"
64,"Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles."
64,"The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles."
64,"As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora."
64,"In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board."
64,"Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace."
64,Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score.
64,The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
65,The galaxy has been a peaceful place for many years.
65,"After the ruthless Terran–Hegemony War (30.027–33.364), much effort has been employed by all major spacefaring species to prevent the terrifying events from repeating themselves."
65,"The Galactic Council was formed to enforce precious peace, and it has taken many courageous efforts to prevent the escalation of malicious acts."
65,"Nevertheless, tension and discord are growing among the seven major species and in the Council itself."
65,"Old alliances are shattering, and hasty diplomatic treaties are made in secrecy."
65,A confrontation of the superpowers seems inevitable – only the outcome of the galactic conflict remains to be seen.
65,Which faction will emerge victorious and lead the galaxy under its rule?

65,Lead your people to victory!
66,Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.
66,"In the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife."
66,"You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat."
66,"(Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.)"
66,"Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available — unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item."
66,"Ideally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's."
66,"At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife."
66,"Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs."
66,Can you make it happen?
67,"Welcome to New Angeles, home of the Beanstalk."
67,"From our branch offices in this monument of human achievement, NBN proudly broadcasts all your favorite media programming."

67,Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players.
67,"Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners."
67,Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them.
67,Doing so takes time and credits.
67,"To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with ""ice""."
67,"These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries."
67,"They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network."
67,"In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures."
67,"Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery."
67,"When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures."
67,It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result.
67,"Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds."
67,"Sometimes, the runner finds something of value."
67,"Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing."
67,"The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity."
67,The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs.
67,"While the cards in this set have been released previously, the art on some of them is new."
68,The survivors of a long-ago invasion have taken refuge in the forgotten underground city of Gravehold.
68,"There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages."
68,"Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card."
68,"Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits."
69,Through the Ages is a civilization building game.
69,"Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military."
69,Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents.
69,The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.
69,One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting.
69,"Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play."
69,"In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it."
69,While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military.
69,Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings.
69,Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players.
69,"There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture."
69,"It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one."
69,Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.
70,2018 UPDATE: The second edition of the game is improved for CVD (color blindness) and includes 5 revised cards from the original version and 6 New Worlds promo homeworlds.
70,The promo homeworlds and first edition compatible Revised Cards are both available for purchase through the BGG store.
70,"In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments."
70,"Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them."
70,"These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses."
70,"At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses."
70,"By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action."
70,"For example, if one player chooses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand."
70,"The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to them."
70,"But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so you must be aware when another player also takes advantage of your choice of role."

Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck."
71,"Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon."
71,"Boots, which are used to move around the board."
71,"Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile."
71,"Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck."
71,"With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck!"
71,"Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they’ll acquire different cards during their turns."
71,"Because cards can do many different things, each player’s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds."
71,"During the game, you have two goals:

Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon."
71,Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!

72,"How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure."
72,"As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn."
72,But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare.
72,You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage.
72,"You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate."

78,This is your opportunity to turn your little café into a world famous hotel.
78,"Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor."
78,Only then will your café become the Grand Austria Hotel.
78,"The start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces."
78,"On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out."
78,The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action.
78,They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions.
78,"With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff."
78,But no hotel can grow without guests.
78,To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions.
78,"The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win."
78,"With 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value."
78,Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.
79,You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World.
79,"Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy."
79,Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.
79,7 Wonders lasts three ages.
79,"In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player."
79,"Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways."
79,"(Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided)."
79,"Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age."
79,"After three ages, the game ends."
79,"In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game."
79,"Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game."
79,Some cards provide discounts on future purchases.
79,Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points.
79,"Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up."
79,"Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions."
79,"Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3–7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions."
80,"Game description from the publisher:
Waterdeep, the City of Splendors – the most resplendent jewel in the Forgotten Realms, and a den of political intrigue and shady back-alley dealings."
80,"In this game, the players are powerful lords vying for control of this great city."
80,"Its treasures and resources are ripe for the taking, and that which cannot be gained through trickery and negotiation must be taken by force!"
80,"In Lords of Waterdeep, a strategy board game for 2-5 players, you take on the role of one of the masked Lords of Waterdeep, secret rulers of the city."
80,"Through your agents, you recruit adventurers to go on quests on your behalf, earning rewards and increasing your influence over the city."
80,"Expand the city by purchasing new buildings that open up new actions on the board, and hinder – or help – the other lords by playing Intrigue cards to enact your carefully laid plans."
80,"During the course of play, you may gain points or resources through completing quests, constructing buildings, playing intrigue cards or having other players utilize the buildings you have constructed."
80,"At the end of 8 rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins the game."
81,"90,000 B.C."
81,— A great ice age is fast approaching.
81,Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.
81,Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.
81,"Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes—mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect."
81,Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another.
81,"But that won’t last: It is indeed ""survival of the fittest""."
81,"Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects."
81,Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal.
81,"Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others."
81,All of this eventually leads to the end game—the final ascent of the ice age—where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species.
81,"But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it’s getting mighty cold...
Game Play
The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago."
81,The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles—converting them into tundra in the process—as the ice age encroaches.
81,"The cylindrical action pawns (or ""AP""s) drive the game."
81,"Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation."
81,"After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase."
81,"Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal’s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents’—hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or ""VP""s) along the way."
81,"The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains."
81,"Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the ""earth"")."
81,Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.
81,"When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile—after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins."

82,"A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike."
82,Difficult decisions or harrowing choices wait behind every corner and seemingly minor tasks may reverberate with major long-term consequences.
82,In a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conﬂict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own.
82,"Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey."
82,"Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle."
82,"To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conﬂicting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality."
82,"These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to diﬀerent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep."
82,The character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters.
82,"Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option."
82,"Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conﬂict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game."
82,"In Avalon, there’s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree."

82,Places and characters are often much more than they seem.
82,"As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner."
82,Many secrets can be discovered only after several games.
82,"Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience."

83,Electric vehicles (EVs) have become more common since 2014 and are the future of the automobile industry.
83,"They are superior vehicles due to them being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and cheaper to run."
83,They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving.
83,"They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion-engine counterparts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them."
83,"You will be overseeing the production of these vehicles in Kanban EV, with ""kanban"" (看板) being the name for a scheduling system that supports an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process."

83,You must make shrewd use of the recycling facilities and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate parts when the suppliers come up short.
83,"Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes."
83,"Sandra, the factory manager, will review your performance and keep the factory on tempo."

85,"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain."
85,"The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions."
85,"To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions."
85,"After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner."
85,"In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply)."
85,A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower).
85,"Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn."
85,The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region.
85,One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region.
85,The other four action cards varying from round to round.
85,The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round.
85,"Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial."
85,Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.
85,Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.
86,Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds.
86,"Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter."
86,"Each player starts the game with a ""home"" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue."
86,Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages.
86,"Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned."
86,"In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood."
86,"In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction."
86,In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game.
86,"Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers."
86,The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.
86,Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game.
86,"Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers."
86,"Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the ""Key"" series from R&D Games set in the medieval ""Key"" land."
87,"Once upon a time ...
1289."
87,"To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built."
87,"For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects."
87,"Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up."
87,The players embody master builders.
87,"By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor."
87,"When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game."
87,The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.
87,"Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village."
87,"These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources."
87,"Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses."
87,"Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings."
87,"The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players."
87,"As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn."
87,Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker.
87,The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn.
87,"The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game."
87,"Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly."
88,"Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is an exciting game of mistrust, intrigue, and the struggle for survival."
88,"Based on the epic and widely-acclaimed Sci Fi Channel series, Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game puts players in the role of one of ten of their favorite characters from the show."
88,"Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival."
88,"However, one or more players in every game secretly side with the Cylons."

88,"After the Cylon attack on the Colonies, the battered remnants of the human race are on the run, constantly searching for the next signpost on the road to Earth."
88,"They face the threat of Cylon attack from without, and treachery and crisis from within."

88,They are also dealt a loyalty card at the start of the game to determine if they are a human or Cylon along with an assortment of skill cards based on their characters abilities.
88,"Players then can move and take actions either on Galactica, on Colonial 1, or in a Viper."
88,"They need to collect skill cards, fend off Cylon ships, and keep Galactica and the fleet jumping."
88,"Each turn also brings a Crisis Card, various tasks that players must overcome."
88,Players need to play matching skill cards to fend off the problems; skill cards that don't match hinder the players success.
88,"Fate could be working against the crew, or there could be a traitorous Cylon!"
88,"As players get closer and closer towards reaching their Earth, another round of loyalty cards are passed out and more Cylons may turn up."
88,"If players can keep their up their food stores, fuel levels, ship morale, and population, and they can keep Galactica in one piece long enough to make it to Earth, the Humans win the game."
88,"But if the Cylon players reveal themselves at the right moment and bring down Galactica, the Humans have lost."

90,"In Troyes (pronounced ""twah""), players recreate four centuries of history of this famous city of the Champagne region of France."
90,"Each player manages their segment of the population (represented by a horde of dice) and their hand of cards, which represent the three primary domains of the city:  religious, military, and civil."
90,Players can also offer cash to their opponents' populace in order to get a little moonlighting out of them — anything for more fame!
90,"Make your underlings:

 work on the cathedral
 combat misfortune
 bustle about the city

91,"In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and spread their trading posts throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money."
91,"""As I expected, the East African Company's network of trading posts has spread far into the West."
91,They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines.
91,"It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town."
91,"After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire."
91,"And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...""
Mombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 18th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies."
91,Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players' shares in these companies.
91,"Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date."
91,"To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning."
91,"Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game."
91,"Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions."
91,"At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board)."
91,Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.
91,"The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game."
91,"With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge."
92,"In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards."
92,"In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can ""buy"" as they can afford them."

94,Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age.
94,"As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements."
94,"To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock."
94,"Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!"
94,"To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain."
94,How you use your plunder is also vital to your success.
94,"Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action."
94,"Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:

 Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies."
94,"This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions."
94,"You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building."
94,"Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn."
94,"To raid a settlement — whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress — you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color."
94,"Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game."
94,"The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores."
95,"Across the globe, ancient evil is stirring."
95,"Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror."
95,"Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond."
95,"All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity."
95,The end draws near!
95,Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?
95,"Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One – that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world."
95,"Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature."
95,Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.
95,"While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it."
95,"It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards."
95,You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city.
95,Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness.
95,You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.
95,"Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep."
95,"If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma."

95,"With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game."

96,—description from the publisher
97,"Lorenzo de' Medici, also known as ""Lorenzo il Magnifico"" (Lorenzo the Magnificent), was one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Italian Renaissance."
97,"In Lorenzo il Magnifico, each player takes the role of the head of a noble family in a city during the Italian Renaissance to gain more prestige and fame — that is, victory points (VP) — than anyone else."
97,"To do so, you send your family members to different areas of town, where they can obtain many achievements."
97,"In one location, they get useful resources; in another development cards that represent newly conquered territories, sponsored buildings, influenced characters, or encouraged ventures; and somewhere else they activate the effects of their cards."
97,Family members are not identical.
97,"At the beginning of each round, you roll three dice to determine their value."
97,"You must choose carefully where to send your most valuable family members...
You can gain VP in several ways, and you must also pay attention to your relations with the Church."
97,"The game is divided into three periods, each formed by two rounds; at the end of each period, players must show their faith, and whoever hasn't prayed enough will suffer hard penalties."
97,"After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins."
97,"The New Edition includes:
- Lorenzo il Magnifico: Houses of Renaissance
- the 24 basic cards of Lorenzo il Magnifico: The Pazzi Conspiracy (but not the 24 KSE cards)

98,"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris & Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement."
98,"Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government."
98,The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories.
98,"However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized."
98,"Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict."
98,Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.
98,"Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris & Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game."
98,"This ""ziggurat expansion"", initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board."
98,"The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile."
98,The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed.
98,All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well.
98,"If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn."
98,"Some versions of Tigris & Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players."
98,Tigris & Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.
99,"Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team."
99,"In more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team."
99,"In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1."
99,They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code.
99,"For example, if the team's four words are ""pig"", ""candy"", ""tent"", and ""son"", then I might say ""Sam-striped-pink"" and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1."
99,"If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure."
99,"Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code."
99,"If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, ""sucker-prince-stake""."
99,The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code.
99,"If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure."
99,(Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)
99,The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game).
99,Games typically last between 4-7 rounds.
99,"If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins."
100,"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network."
100,"In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks."
100,"The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery."
100,Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology.
100,"Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition."
100,There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails?
100,Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?
100,"Game Summary
Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities)."
100,"On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail)."
100,"Some interesting twists:
- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white)."
100,Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.
100,"- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc."
100,- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.
100,The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers.
100,Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together).
100,"Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location."
100,"These provide a variety of abilities, for example:
- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces
- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line."
100,"- earn 2 coins
- take 2 temporary workers
- jump ahead in turn order
- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you
Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers."
100,"Then, score VP for each track and factory line."
100,"On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score."
100,Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts.
100,Track types built earlier (e.g.
100,"black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white)."
100,On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.
100,"After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!"
101,"In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board."
101,"To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch."
101,Each player takes five buttons — the currency/points in the game — and someone is chosen as the start player.
101,"On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes."
101,"To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch."
101,"You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible."
101,"If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes."
101,"Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved."
101,"In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn ""button income"": sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank."
101,"What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces."
101,Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.
101,"Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game."
101,"(Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)"
101,"When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank."
101,"Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place."
101,"Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board."
101,Scores can be negative.
101,The player with the most points wins.
102,"The Isle of Cats is a competitive, medium-weight, card-drafting, polyomino cat-placement board game for 1-4 players (6 with expansions)."
102,"In the game, you are citizens of Squalls End on a rescue mission to The Isle of Cats and must rescue as many cats as possible before the evil Lord Vesh arrives."
102,"Each cat is represented by a unique tile and belongs to a family, you must find a way to make them all fit on your boat while keeping families together."
102,"You will also need to manage resources as you:

 Explore the island (by drafting cards)
 Rescue cats
 Find treasures
 Befriend Oshax
 Study ancient lessons

Each lesson you collect gives you another personal way of scoring points, and 38 unique lessons are available."
102,"Complete lessons, fill your boat, and keep cat families together to score points, and the player with the most points after five rounds wins."
102,"Note: The Isle of Cats: Kickstarter Edition is a compilation item consisting of The Isle of Cats base game and The Isle of Cats: Kickstarter Pack, each of which are available as separate items and listed individually in the BGG database."
103,"Beyond the Sun is a space civilization game in which players collectively decide the technological progress of humankind at the dawn of the Spacefaring Era, while competing against each other to be the leading faction in economic development, science, and galactic influence."
103,The game is played over a variable number of rounds until a number of game-end achievements are collectively claimed by the players.
103,"The winner is the faction with the most victory points, which are obtained by researching technologies, improving their economy, controlling and colonizing systems, and completing various achievements and events throughout the game."
103,"On a turn, a player moves their action pawn to an empty action space, then takes that action."
103,"They then conduct their production phase, either producing ore, growing their population, or trading one of those resources for another."
103,"Finally, they can claim up to one achievement, if possible."
103,"As players take actions, they research new technologies that come in four levels."
103,"Each technology is one of four types (scientific, economic, military, commercial), and higher-level technologies must match one of the types of tech that lead into it."
103,"Thus, players create their own technology tree in each game, using these actions to increase their military strength, to jump to different habitable exoplanetary systems, to colonize those systems, to boost their resource production, to develop android tech that allows growth without population, and more."
104,"The great and forgotten Kami have returned from the underworld, displeased with the affairs of the Empire’s present Shōgun."
104,"At the start of spring in the Great New Year, the Kami have gathered their sacred clans with one quest: reclaim the lands of Nippon and return them to their honorable, spiritual traditions."
104,"However, each clan is bound by their own proud traditions to a unique vision for this great return and must wage a powerful diplomatic war across eight provinces."
104,"Alliances must be forged, betrayal is inevitable, honorable standing rises and falls."
104,"Political mandates must be navigated and devastating war must be fought, each won by expert skill and cunning negotiation."
104,And only one may stand victorious at the coming of winter.
104,"You, honorable Shōgun, lead one of these great clans."
104,"Do you have the strength of honor, virtue, and spirit, as well as the mastery of steel necessary to deliver on this ancient promise?"
104,Rising  Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan.
104,Each player chooses a Clan and competes to lead theirs to victory by accumulating Victory Points over the course of the Seasons.
104,"Each Clan possesses a unique ability and differs in Seasonal Income, Starting Honor Rank, and Home Province."
104,"Over the course of the game, players will forge and break alliances, choose political actions, worship the gods, customize their clans, and position their figures around Japan."
104,"In the process, Honor is a palpable element in Rising Sun: Having high Honor gives several advantages, while having low Honor may grant the allegiance of the darker elements of the world."
104,"But above all, Honor settles all disputes: Whenever there is a tie, the tied player with the highest Honor wins."
104,"In Rising  Sun, players are encouraged to use diplomacy, negotiation, and even bribery to further their cause."
104,Players can make deals at any point in the game but no deals are truly binding.
104,"Victory Points can be gained in several ways, from winning battles, to harvesting the right provinces, to playing to the Virtues accumulated by your Clan."
104,"The game is played over the course of 4 rounds or Seasons: Spring, Summer, and then Autumn; when  Winter  comes,  the  game  draws to a close and players calculate bonuses to decide who is the winner."
104,"Each Season is divided into five phases: 
1) Seasonal Setup because every Season has a certain Season deck with different cards, 
2) Tea Ceremony in which players sit down and negotiate their Alliances for the Season, 
3) Political Phase during which players will select Political Mandates to prepare their Clans and position their forces,
4) War Phase, during which players battle over several Provinces, and 
5) Seasonal Cleanup."
104,"As already mentioned, the start of the Winter Season signifies the end of the game."
104,"Peace falls over the land as it gets covered in white snow, and a new Emperor will rise under the power of the great Kami."
105,Inis is a game deeply rooted in Celtic history and lore in which players win by being elected King of the Island (Inis).
105,"Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:

 Leadership: Be the leader — i.e., have more clan figures than any other player — of territories containing at least six opponents' clans."
105,Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.
105,Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.
105,"Over the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition."
105,"While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island."
105,"At the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly."
105,Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next.
105,Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly.
105,Each Assembly reallocates those cards.
105,"Finally, they collect ""epic tales"" cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others."
105,These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances.
105,"The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions."
105,"Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory."
105,"After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom."
105,"While Inis has ""dudes"" that are ""on a map"", it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition."
105,"Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement."
105,"Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards)."
105,That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors.
105,"Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor."
106,"Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture."
106,The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games.
106,"In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau."
106,"At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau."
106,"On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order."
106,"Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile."
106,What are you trying to do with these actions?
106,"Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you – and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too."
106,At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty.
106,"In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans."
106,"With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome."
106,"All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player."
107,"In Cthulhu: Death May Die, inspired by the writings of H.P."
107,"Lovecraft, you and your fellow players represent investigators in the 1920s who instead of trying to stop the coming of Elder Gods, want to summon those otherworldly beings so that you can put a stop to them permanently."
107,"You start the game insane, and while your long-term goal is to shoot Cthulhu in the face, so to speak, at some point during the game you'll probably fail to mitigate your dice rolls properly and your insanity will cause you to do something terrible — or maybe advantageous."
107,Hard to know for sure.
107,"The game has multiple episodes, and each of them has a similar structure of two acts, those being before and after you summon whatever it is you happen to be summoning."
107,"If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win."
107,The episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.
108,"The evil Lord Eradikus has all but conquered the galaxy and is now on a victory lap across the sector in his flagship, Eradikus Prime."
108,"He may rule with an iron grip, but his most prized artifacts are about to slip through his cyborg claws."
108,"You and your fellow thieves have challenged each other to sneak aboard his ship, hack your way into its command module, and steal from him."
108,"Along the way, you'll recruit allies and snatch up extra loot."
108,But one false step and — Clank!
108,Careless noise draws the attention of Lord Eradikus.
108,Hacking into his command module and stealing his artifacts increases his rage.
108,"You'd better hope your friends are louder than you are if you want to make it to an escape pod and get out alive...
Clank!"
108,In!
108,Space!
108,is built on the same game system as Clank!
108,": A Deck-Building Adventure, with players building a personal deck of cards throughout the course of the game, with the cards allowing them to move through the spaceship, attack things, acquire new cards, and — oh yeah — make noise to attract Lord Eradikus and potentially seal their own doom."
109,"Trickerion is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a fictional world inspired by the late 19th century urban life and culture, spiced with a pinch of supernatural."
109,"Players take on the roles of rival stage illusionists, each with their own strengths and characteristics."
109,"They are striving for fortune and fame in a competition hosted by a legendary magician, looking for a successor worthy of the mighty Trickerion Stone, which is fabled to grant supernatural power to its owner."
109,"Using worker placement and simultaneous action selection mechanisms, the Illusionists and their teams of helpers — the Engineer, the Assistant, the Manager, and a handful of Apprentices – obtain blueprints and components for increasingly complex magic tricks, expand the team and set up performances by visiting the Downtown, Dark Alley, Market Row and Theater locations on the main game board depicting a late 19th century cityscape."
109,"The tricks are stored and prepared on the Magician's own Workshop game board, while the performances themselves take place at the Theater in the form of a tile placement mini-game with lots of player interaction."
109,The performances yield Fame points and Coins to their owners based on the tricks they consist of.
109,"Fame points have multiple uses, but they also serve as a win condition - After turn 7, when the last Performance card is revealed, the game ends and the illusionist with the most Fame points wins."
109,"The game offers 48 different Tricks to be learned from the Optical, Spiritual, Mechanical and Escape categories, over 90 character abilities, and 40 Special Assignment cards that influence the actions taken at the various game locations."
109,The base game can be expanded with two optional rule modules to add further strategic depth to the game.
109,"The ""Dark Alley"" expansion included in the base game adds a new location to the game."
109,"It also comes with 48 new Special Assignment cards, a new tier of Tricks, and 27 Prophecy tokens that can alter certain game rules turn by turn, giving the game additional variety."

110,"You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner."
110,But wait!
110,It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea.
110,"You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way."
110,"To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury."
110,"Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted."""

In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards."
110,"In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can ""buy"" as they can afford them."
110,"Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end."
110,"Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck."

Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils."
127,They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents.
127,"Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the ‘Imascheren’ (or nobles)."

127,In each round their new offerings are made.
127,"Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards."

127,Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares).
127,"You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple."

132,Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).
132,Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat.
132,It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat.
132,"As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck."
132,You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases.
132,"When you reduce your opponent’s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!"
132,"Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios."
132,"Also, in the newest version, there are new ways to play that allow up to 6 players with modes like Boss, Hunter, and Free for All."
132,You can also add Star Realms Colony Wars to the deck to make it 4 players.
132,This is the first game of the Star Realms series.
132,"Factions
Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult."
132,"Trade Federation
In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership."
132,The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation.
132,"The Federation’s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder."
132,"While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation’s trade and other interests."
132,"The Blobs
These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race."
132,Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated.
132,"On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, “The Blobs”."
132,"While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row."
132,"Star Empire
The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation."
132,These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation.
132,"Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs."
132,"As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies."
132,The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.
132,"Machine Cult
A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs."
132,"With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures."
132,"Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population."
132,"Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion."
132,The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.
132,"Playing Star Realms
​When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions."
132,"Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however."
132,"As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck."
132,"When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn."
132,"When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn."
132,"In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent’s Authority to zero and win the game, it’s also useful for destroying your opponent’s Bases."
132,Some Bases are designated as Outposts.
132,Your opponent’s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent’s Authority directly.
132,"Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you’re familiar with deck-building games, but it’s a game that takes time to master."
132,"Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points."
132,Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent?
132,Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available?
132,Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat?
132,Should I attack my opponent’s Base or their Authority?
132,These are just some of the many choices you’ll be faced with.
132,"New players needn’t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability."
133,"Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game, based on the four movies of the Alien series, is a fully cooperative game with original art."

136,"Was your targeting computer damaged, affecting your ability to acquire a lock on the enemy?"

141,Concordia Venus is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-6 players aged 13 and up.

141,"In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth."
141,Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game.
141,"These cards serve two purposes:
They allow a player to choose actions during the game."
141,They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.
141,Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves.
141,"Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities on the 4 different maps included with the game."
141,"When all cards have been sold from the market or after the first player builds his 15th house, the game ends."
141,"The player with the most VPs from the gods (Jupiter, Saturnus, Mercurius, Minerva, Vesta, Venus, etc.)"
141,wins the game.
141,Teams of two players each may play against each other.

142,"As an architect in Welcome To..., you want to build the best new town in the United States of the 1950s by adding resources to a pool, hiring employees, and more."
142,Welcome To... plays like a roll-and-write dice game in which you mark results on a score-sheet...but without dice.
142,Instead you flip cards from three piles to make three different action sets with both a house number and a corresponding action from which everyone chooses one.
142,You use the number to fill in a house on your street in numerical order.
142,Then you take the action to increase the point value of estates you build or score points at the end for building parks and pools.
142,Players also have the option of taking actions to alter or duplicate their house numbers.
142,And everyone is racing to be the first to complete public goals.
142,There's lots to do and many paths to becoming the best suburban architect in Welcome To...!
142,"Because of the communal actions, game play is simultaneous and thus supports large groups of players."
142,"With many varying strategies and completely randomized action sets, no two games will feel the same!"
143,There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors.
143,"Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations."
143,Your goal?
143,Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.
143,"In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar."
143,"At each such location, you can carry out a specific action."
143,"The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters)."
143,"If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up."
143,"Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything..."
143,"In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action."
143,"If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action."
143,"Possible actions include:

Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good."
143,Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.
143,"Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect."
143,Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.
143,Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.

144,"The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with up to three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them."
144,"Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them."
144,"However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once."
144,"Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next."
144,The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly.
144,"The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R."
144,"Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks."
144,Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios.
144,"The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck."
144,"The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players."
144,"Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, typical scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire."
144,The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books.
144,"These saga-quests can optionally be played together as a Campaign Mode, with lasting consequences arising from the players' actions and decisions."
145,Just One is a cooperative party game in which you play together to discover as many mystery words as possible.
145,Find the best clue to help your teammate.
145,"Be unique, as all identical clues will be cancelled!"
145,A complete game is played over 13 cards.
145,The goal is to get a score as close to 13 as possible.
145,"In case of a right answer, the players score 1 point."
145,"In case of wrong answer, they lose the current card as well as the top card of the deck."
145,Thus losing 2 points.
145,"In case of lack of answer, the players only lose the current card, and therefore only 1 point."
145,You have the choice – make the difference!
145,"Small Historical Point:
Originally, Just One was called We Are The Word and was published by Fun Consortium."
145,Repos Production bought the rights in early 2018 and adapted the game.
145,"The Sombrero-wearing Belgians decided to improve the quality of the components, add 50 new words, and change the name of the game."
145,"Following this new edition, the game went from having only a French edition to having a world-wide edition."
146,Through tactics and karma to wealth and fame...
146,"In 16th century India, the powerful empire of the Great Moguls rises between the Indus and the Ganges rivers."
146,Taking on the role of rajas and ranis – the country's influential nobles – players in Rajas of the Ganges race against each other in support of the empire by developing their estates into wealthy and magnificent provinces.
146,"Players must use their dice wisely and carefully plot where to place their workers, while never underestimating the benefits of good karma."
146,Success will bring them great riches and fame in their quest to become legendary rulers.
147,"Choose your dice well in Ganz schön clever to enter them into the matching colored area, put together tricky chain-scoring opportunities, and rack up the points."
147,"The dice you don't use are as important as what you do because every die that's smaller than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times."
148,Charles IV has been crowned King of Bohemia and ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.
148,"From his castle in Prague, he oversees construction of new fortifications: a bridge across the Vltava River, a university, and a cathedral rising within the walls of the castle itself."
148,Prague is already among the largest cities in Europe.
148,King Charles will make it the capital of an empire!
148,"In Praga Caput Regni, players take the role of wealthy citizens who are organizing various building projects in medieval Prague."
148,"By expanding their wealth and joining in the construction, they gain favor with the king."
148,"Players choose from six actions on the game board — the ""action crane"" — that are always available, but which are weighted with a constantly shifting array of costs and benefits."
148,"By using these actions, you can increase your resources, improve the strength of your chosen actions, and build ""New Prague City"", the Charles Bridge, or city walls."
148,You can possibly gain additional actions or even participate in the construction of St. Vitus Cathedral.
148,Clever players will discover synergies between carefully timed actions and the rewards from constructing civic projects as all of the mechanisms mesh together.
148,"At the end of the game, the player who most impressed King Charles wins."

150,"At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each."

154,"In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA)."
154,"Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not."
154,"The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice-versa."

154,Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn.

155,"If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold."
155,"The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry!"
155,"On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!"
155,"You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly."
156,"Glen More II: Chronicles is a sequel to Glen More, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game."
156,"In Glen More II: Chronicles, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth."
156,"The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles."
156,"The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles."
156,"After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference."
156,"After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play."
156,"The core mechanism of Glen More II: Chronicles and Glen More functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track."
156,"After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc."
156,Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.
156,"Improvements over the original Glen More include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve."
156,"The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to Glen More."
156,"The ""Chronicles"" in the title — a set of eight expansions to the base game — are a major part of these new mechanisms."
156,Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game.
156,"The ""Highland Boat Race"" Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories."
156,"The ""Hammer of the Scots"" Chronicle adds a neutral ""Englishman"" playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn — if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism."
156,"All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a ""monster game""."
156,"Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new ""person"" tile type."
156,"Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board."
156,"This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board."

GAME SYSTEM



 This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole."
157,It is not for a specific product or release.
157,Versions will appear on the individual item pages.
157,"From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker—a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest."
157,Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal.
157,It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.
157,This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.
157,"Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare."
157,Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.
157,Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.
157,Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.
157,The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.
157,"An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck."
157,"There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!"
157,"Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used."
157,"Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect."
157,Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.
157,"Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells."
157,"A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called ""the stack,"" provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn."
157,"Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play."
158,"Viscounts of the West Kingdom is set at a time when the King’s reign began to decline, circa 980 AD."
158,"Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes."
158,But peace is a tenuous affair.
158,"As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown."
158,"Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain."
158,"As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive."
158,"Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power."
158,The aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end.
158,"Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land."
158,"Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours."
158,"Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society."
158,The game ends once the Kingdom reaches poverty or prosperity - or potentially both!

162,"Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game."
162,Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game.
162,"This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony!"
162,"Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing."
162,"Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!"
162,"Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world."
162,"The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up."
162,"Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves."
162,The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.
163,"Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games' popular Railways of the World series, first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005."
163,It reimplements the original game with several improvements.

163,"This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas."
163,"Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience."
163,"A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map."
163,"Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game

164,This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.
164,"You will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity."
164,"During day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements’ shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you’ll try to keep it warm."
164,Upon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders.
164,"Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.)."
164,"On your way you will meet tens of characters, each with a unique story (residents of the locations you visit, thieves, bandits, soldiers, war victims, refugees, neighbors, traders and members of local communities), each encounter is a potential, unique adventure."
164,"To guide you through all these events you will have the special SCRIPTS mechanism, responsible for implementing the deep and complex story and a coherent plot (each game will be unique and different than the previous)."
164,Your goal is to SURVIVE until the cessation of war hostilities.
164,"During your struggle as the survivors, you will experience dramas connected with making extremely difficult decisions and choices (you will have to face the consequences of your actions sooner or later in the playthrough)."
164,Survival itself will often prove not to be enough.
164,"The price each of you will decide to pay, might be too high in the final outcome."
164,So the goal is really to survive in a way that will let you live on with the decisions you made.
164,The EPILOGUES mechanism will kick in here.
164,"TWOM: The Board Game features a multiplayer experience for up to 6 players, as well as a solo variant."
164,You will be able to personify one of the well-known characters from the electronic version of the game and face hundreds of new challenges and difficult choices.
164,"The boardgame significantly broadens the original game’s universe and emphasises the depth of plot, yet its main focus will be on human interactions driven by survival instinct and group decision-making."
164,"The project aims to omit the usual boardgame threshold - TWOM: The Board Game is an INSTANT PLAY game, with no need for reading the manual before starting the adventure."
164,Experience the simulation of a struggle for survival as a group of civilians facing a blind and merciless war.
164,"In war, not everyone is a soldier."
165,Build a galactic empire...
165,"In the depths of space, the alien races of the Cosmos vie with each other for control of the universe."
165,"Alliances form and shift from moment to moment, while cataclysmic battles send starships screaming into the warp."
165,This classic game of alien politics returns from the warp once more!
165,"In Cosmic Encounter, each player becomes the leader of one of dozens of alien races, each with its own unique power."
165,"On a player's turn, he or she becomes the offense."
165,The offense encounters another player on a planet by moving a group of his or her ships through the hyperspace gate to that planet.
165,Both sides can invite allies and play cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.
165,The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems.
165,The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system.
165,These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems.
165,"The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory."
165,"And, because alliances are a key part of the game, multiple players can win together!"
166,"In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time."
166,"You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims."
166,Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.
166,"In the game, each player starts with a simple foyer."
166,"One player takes on the role of the Master Builder, and that player sets prices for a set of rooms that can be purchased by the other players, with him getting to pick from the leftovers after the other players have paid him for their rooms."
166,"When a room is added to a castle, the player who built it gains castle points based on the size and type of room constructed, as well as bonus points based on the location of the room."
166,"When a room is completed, with all entranceways leading to other rooms in the castle, the player receives one of seven special rewards."
166,"After each purchasing round, a new player becomes the Master Builder who sets prices for a new set of rooms."
166,"After several rounds, the game ends, then additional points are awarded for achieving bonus goals, having the most popular rooms, and being the most responsive to the King's demands, which change each game."
166,Whoever ends up with the most castle points wins.
167,"In Ora et Labora (Latin for 'Pray and work'), each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings – little enterprises that will gain resources and profit."
167,"The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items – such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics – to gain the most victory points at the end of the game."
167,"Ora et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth ""big"" game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful."
167,"Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time."
167,"At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time."
167,Each player has a personal game board.
167,"New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where."
167,"Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed."
167,"Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed."
167,Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location.
167,Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three.
167,"You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you."
167,Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.
168,Draft dice and use the tools-of-the-trade in Sagrada to carefully construct your stained glass window masterpiece.
168,"In more detail, each player builds a stained glass window by building up a grid of dice on their player board."
168,Each board has some restrictions on which color or shade (value) of die can be placed there.
168,Dice of the same shade or color may never be placed next to each other.
168,"Dice are drafted in player order, with the start player rotating each round, snaking back around after the last player drafts two dice."
168,Scoring is variable per game based on achieving various patterns and varieties of placement...as well as bonus points for dark shades of a particular hidden goal color.
168,"Special tools can be used to help you break the rules by spending skill tokens; once a tool is used, it then requires more skill tokens for the other players to use them."
168,The highest scoring window artisan wins!
169,"Game description from the publisher:
King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for battle."
169,"In the second edition of A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare."
169,Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R.
169,"Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win."
169,"Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side?"
169,"Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!"
169,"To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components."
169,"Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses."
169,"Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase."
169,The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros.
169,"There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players."
169,The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important.
169,"Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine)."
169,This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction.
169,Can you trust the alliance that you made?
169,Will you betray your ally and march upon him?
169,"Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding."
169,"The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!"
169,"During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered!"
169,"When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle."
169,"Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes."
169,"In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards."
169,"Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity."
169,"During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card."
169,"What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements."
169,"Expanded by:

 A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) – A Dance with Dragons (2012)

170,Tyrants of the Underdark is a territory control game with a deck-building element.
170,Each player leads a house of Drow in a section of the Underdark below the Sword Coast.
170,"The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck."
170,"Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your ""inner circle"", which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game."
170,"When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals."
170,"A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed."
170,"The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops."
170,"Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins."
171,"In Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species, and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life."
171,Dino cooking!
171,"All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!)"
171,the most visitors each season that the park opens.
171,Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors?
171,"They'll definitely excite potential visitors, but you'd better make a large enough enclosure for them."
171,And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security.
171,"Or they WILL break out and start eating your visitors, and we all know how that ends."
171,"You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores, but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face)."
171,So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to attract visitors to your park the good old-fashioned way?
172,"The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years."
172,"Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord)."
172,"The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide."
172,Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason.
172,Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.
172,To conquer Japan you must do more than field an army - you must be sure it will follow you into combat.
172,Cultivate the loyalty of your allies and deploy them only when you are confident of their allegiance.
172,Win a battle by gaining a defection from the ranks of your opponent.
172,"Sekigahara is replete with unusual mechanics:

    No dice are used
    Cards represent loyalty and motivation."
172,"Without a matching card, an army will not enter battle."
172,"Allegiance is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each turn."
172,"Battles are a series of deployments, from hidden unit stacks, based on hidden loyalty factors."
172,Loyalty Challenge cards create potential defection events.
172,Sekigahara is a 3-hour block game based on the Japanese campaign waged in 1600.
172,"The 7-week war, fought along Japan's two major highways and in scattered sieges and backcountry skirmishes, elevated Tokugawa Ieyasu to Shogun and unified Japan for 265 years."
172,Sekigahara is designed to offer an historically authentic experience within an intuitive game mechanic that can be played in one sitting.
172,Great effort has been taken to preserve a clean game mechanism.
172,"(Despite a healthy amount of historical detail, the ruleset is a brief 6 pages.)"
172,Chance takes the form of uncertainty and not luck.
172,No dice are used; combat is decided with cards.
172,Blocks = armies and cards = motivation.
172,The combination of army and motivation produces impact on the battlefield.
172,Armies without matching cards don't fight.
172,"Battles resolve quickly, but with suspense, tactical participation, and a wide range of possible outcomes."
172,"Legitimacy is represented by hand size, which fluctuates each week according to the number of castles a player holds."
172,"Certain events deplete legitimacy, like force marches and lost battles."
172,"Recruitment, meanwhile, is a function of a daimyo's control over key production areas."
172,"Objectives (enemy units, castles, resources) exist all over the map."
172,"The initial setup is variable, so the situation is always fresh."
172,Concealed information (blocks and cards) lends additional uncertainty.
172,In this way the game feels like the actual campaign.
172,Blocks are large and stackable.
172,"Every unit on the board is visible at once, and the strategic situation is comprehensible at a glance."
172,"Components use authentic clan designations and colors, and have a Japanese feel."
172,"True to history, the objectives (castles and economic centers) and forces (armies of allied daimyo) are dispersed."
172,Support for one front means neglect for another.
172,The player is pulled between competing priorities.
172,"Each side wonders where his opponent wants to fight, and where he is unready."
172,There is a great deal of bluff in the game.
172,"Each player must rally the several daimyo of his coalition, managing the morale and motivation of each clan."
172,"The forces are dispersed, and while there are reasons to unify them, the objectives are also dispersed, and the timeframe compact, so skirmishing will occur all over the island."
172,"TIME SCALE     1 week per 2-player turns

173,War Chest is an all-new bag-building war game!
173,"At the start of the game, raise your banner call (drafting) several various units into your army, which you then use to capture key points on the board."
173,"To succeed in War Chest, you must successfully manage not only your armies on the battlefield, but those that are waiting to be deployed."
173,"Each round you draw three unit coins from your bag, then take turns using them to perform actions."
173,Each coin shows a military unit on one side and can be used for one of several actions.
173,The game ends when one player — or one team in the case of a four-player game — has placed all of their control markers.
173,That player or team wins!

174,"Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis."
174,"Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns."
174,Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents.
174,"Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth."
174,"As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation."
174,"As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high-rise office building."
174,"As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population — and the player with the largest population at the end of the game wins."
174,"During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost — and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!"
174,"The second edition of Suburbia features updated artwork, larger tiles than in the original game, a dual-sided scoreboard, GameTrayz storage organizers, and more!"
175,"Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries takes you on a Nordic adventure through Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden as you travel to the great northern cities of Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, and Stockholm."
175,"This version was initially available only in the Nordic Countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; a worldwide limited-edition release occurred in August 2008 and it has since been kept in print again by Days of Wonder."
175,"The goal in ""Nordic"" remains the same as base Ticket to Ride: collect and play cards to place your trains on the board, attempting to connect the different cities on your ticket cards."
175,The map incorporates tunnels from Europe and also has routes containing ferries.
175,"Ferries will require a certain number of Locomotives to be played, as well as other cards, in order to be claimed."
175,Locomotives are handled a bit differently as well.
175,"On your turn you may take 2 Locomotives if you want, but you can only use them on ferries, tunnels, or the special 9 length route."
175,"Unlike the USA or Europe maps, Nordic is designed for 2-3 players only and has a heavier focus on blocking your opponent and more aggressive play."
175,"Although not an official expansion for this set, Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 – United Kingdom & Pennsylvania can be used as an expansion for Nordic Countries, although limited to the three players included in this set."
175,"Nordic Countries includes three sets of 40 trains, with 5 spare for each colour; the UK map in Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 – United Kingdom & Pennsylvania requires 35 trains and the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains."
175,Part of the Ticket to Ride series.
176,"From the designer (about his Commands and Colors system, C&C: Ancients, and Memoir' 44):
""Commands & Colors: Ancients depicts warfare from the Dawn of Military History (3000 BC) to the opening of the Middle Ages (400 AD)."
176,"Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands & Colors by design is a unique historical game system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history."
176,"The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system."
176,"The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama."""
176,"""The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle."
176,"For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors."
176,"But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time."""
176,"""Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill Games, Inc., Commands & Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter."
176,"Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour."""
176,"""The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities."
176,"There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards."""
176,"""The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly."
176,"Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol."""
176,"""The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory."""
177,Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition is an engine-building game in which players control interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable).
177,You will do this by investing mega credits (MC) into project cards that will directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process.
177,"In order to win, you will want to accumulate a high terraform rating (TR) and as many victory points (VP) as you can."
177,"Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters: oceans, oxygen, and temperature."
177,"TR also determines each corporation's basic income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP."
177,Additional VP and production capabilities are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.
177,"The game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases, which determines which activities will take place during that round."
177,"This means every round is different, but can consist of building new project cards, taking general and project-specific actions, producing income and resources (plants and heat), or researching to draw more project cards."
177,"Every player will take all the phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during the phase that they selected."
177,"To speed up the game, players should resolve each phase simultaneously!"
177,"The game board has tracks for oxygen, temperature, and terraform rating, as well as a place for all of the ocean tiles that will be flipped over the course of the game."
177,"The game ends when there is enough oxygen to breath (14%), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather (9), and the temperature is well above freezing (+8°C)."
177,"It will then be possible, if not comfortable, to live on the surface of Mars!"
177,The winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.
178,"Four wanderers search for the Last Ruin, a city that legends say contains an artifact that will grant the greatest desires of the heart."
178,"A lost love, redemption, acceptance, a family rejoined-- these are the fires that fuel the wanderers' journeys, but can they overcome their own greed and inner demons on the way?"
178,"In Near and Far, you and up to three friends explore many different maps in a search for the Last Ruin, recruiting adventurers, hunting for treasure, and competing to be the most storied traveler."
178,"You must collect food and equipment at town for long journeys to mysterious locales, making sure not to forget enough weapons to fight off bandits, living statues, and rusty robots!"
178,"Sometimes in your travels you'll run into something unique and one of your friends will read what happens to you from a book of stories, giving you a choice of how to react, creating a new and memorable tale each time you play."
178,Near and Far is a sequel to Above and Below and includes a book of encounters.
178,This time players read over ten game sessions to reach the end of the story.
178,Each chapter is played on a completely new map with unique art and adventures.
178,Answer the call of the ruins and begin your journey.
178,Errata
179,Calico is a puzzly tile-laying game of quilts and cats.
179,"In Calico, players compete to sew the coziest quilt as they collect and place patches of different colors and patterns."
179,"Each quilt has a particular pattern that must be followed, and players are also trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats!"
179,Turns are simple.
179,"Select a single patch tile from your hand and sew it into your quilt, then draw another patch into your hand from the three available."
179,"If you are able to create a color group, you may sew a button onto your quilt."
179,"If you are able to create a pattern combination that is attractive to any of the cats, it will come over and curl up on your quilt!"
179,"At the end of the game, you score points for buttons, cats, and how well you were able to complete your unique quilt pattern."

180,"June, 1944: Through the D-Day landings, the Allies have seized a foothold on the beaches of Normandy."
180,Now you must lead your troops forward as you push deeper into France and drive the German forces back.
180,"You will face intense resistance, machine gun fire, and mortar bombardment, but a great commander can turn the situation to their advantage!"
180,"Undaunted: Normandy is a deck-building game that places you and your opponent in command of American or German forces, fighting through a series of missions critical to the outcome of World War II."
180,"Use your cards to seize the initiative, bolster your forces, or control your troops on the battlefield."
180,"Strong leadership can turn the tide of battle in your favor, but reckless decisions could prove catastrophic as every casualty you take removes a card from your deck."
180,"Take charge amidst the chaos of battle, hold fast in the face of opposition, and remain undaunted."
180,—description from the publisher
181,Life in the village is hard – but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please.
181,One villager might want to become a friar.
181,Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office.
181,A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.
181,Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways.
181,"There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish."
181,Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.
181,Village is a game full of tactical challenges.
181,A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions.
181,"Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management."
181,"Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:
Each player’s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from."
181,"The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house."
181,"Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold."
181,"Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round."
181,"Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring."
181,The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.
181,The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.
182,"At the bottom of the ocean, no one will hear you scream!"
182,"In Captain Sonar, you and your teammates control a state-of-the-art submarine and are trying to locate an enemy submarine in order to blow it out of the water before they can do the same to you."
182,"Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless."
182,"Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer."
182,"All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat."
182,Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous.
182,"In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too."
182,"When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded — then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor."
182,Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.
183,Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II.
183,One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia).
183,These two players will take turns playing one or more “Fate” cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.
183,Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent’s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible.
183,"The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario’s specific “Objective” chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent’s board edge."
183,A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time.
183,"There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card ""Orders"" conducted by the active player."
183,"Fate Card ""Actions"" may generally be conducted by either player at any time."
183,"""Events"" — both good and bad — will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player’s perfect plan."
183,SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters).
183,Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time.
183,Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.
183,"Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad."
183,"Radios — and individual weapons larger than a pistol, rifle or BAR — are represented by their own counters."
184,"From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations."
184,"Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself."
184,Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases.
184,They must build a productive economy.
184,"And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!"
184,Nations is an intense historical board game for 1–5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play.
184,Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I.
184,"The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities."
184,"Gameplay introduction
Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series."
184,"After the growth phase, 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round."
184,"Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed."
184,"Actions are:

 Buy a card
 Deploy a worker
 Hire an architect for a wonder
 Special action provided by a card

Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation."
184,"There are many ways that players affect, compete, and indirectly interact with other players."
184,"But there is no map, no units to move around, and no direct attacks on other players."
184,"When all have passed, there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen, and if this is the last round of an age, the books are scored."
184,"At the start of a new round, most old cards are removed and new ones are put on the display."
184,"Victory points are gained and lost during the game, and also awarded at the end of the game."
184,The player with the most victory points is the winner.
184,"See 'More information' below for link to rules, etc."
185,"Colony Wars is a deckbuilding game in the Star Realms series which is both a standalone box set for two players (featuring an 80-card trade deck, as in the original) and an expansion for the base Star Realms set that allows it to be played as a four-player game."
185,"In Colony Wars, as in Star Realms, players will start with a fleet (deck) of 10 basic ships, and can spend Trade to acquire more powerful ships and bases from a central trade row of 5 cards."
185,This row is continuously replenished by random draws from the trade deck.
185,Many ships and bases deal Combat damage which you can use to attack your opponent and/or destroy their bases.
185,"When you reduce your opponent's Authority to zero, you win."
186,"In the 15th and 16th century, Portugal is thriving under its leading role during the Age of Discovery."
186,"Nestled in the heart of Portugal, the city of Coimbra serves as a cultural center of the country."
186,"As the head of one of Coimbra's oldest houses, you seek to earn prestige by deepening relationships with nearby monasteries or funding expeditions of the era."
186,"To reach this goal, you must vie for the favors of the city's most influential citizens, even if you must offer a bit of coin or some protective detail."
186,Coimbra introduces an innovative new dice mechanism in which the dice players draft each round are used in multiple different ways and have an impact on many aspects of their decision making.
186,"While there are many paths to victory, players should always seek to optimize their opportunities with every roll of the dice."
186,"Combined with ever-changing synergies of the citizens, expeditions, and monasteries, no two games of Coimbra will ever be the same!"
187,"""You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens."
187,"Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams!"
187,"You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees."
187,You want a Dominion!
187,"In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums."
187,"All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy."
187,"You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner."
187,"""But wait!"
187,It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea.
187,"You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way."
187,"To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury."
187,"Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.'""'"
187,"In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards."
187,"In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can ""buy"" as they can afford them."
187,"Through their selection of cards to buy and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end."
187,"Dominion is not a collectible card game (CCG), but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck."
187,The game comes with 500 cards.
187,You select 10 of the 26 Kingdom card types to include in any given play—leading to immense variety.
187,"Dominion (Second Edition) replaces six Kingdom card types from the first edition with six new types of Kingdom cards, while also replacing the blank cards in the game with a seventh new Kingdom card."
187,These new cards are available on their own in the Dominion: Update Pack.
187,"The rulebook has been rewritten, three cards have mild functional changes (""you may"" added to Moneylender, Mine, Throne Room), and other cards have been rephrased (while remaining functionally the same)."
187,"Dominion: Update Pack contains the seven new kingdom cards introduced in the second edition of Dominion, thereby allowing owners of the first edition to obtain these new cards without needing to repurchase the entire game."
188,"By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19×19 (or smaller) grid of intersections."
188,"But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth."
188,"One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones."
188,"The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins."
188,"The earliest mention of Go (圍棋 (wéi qí)- ""surrounding game"") appears in the ""Analects"" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17×17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD)."
188,"There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers."
188,One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son.
188,A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess.
188,"A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards)."
188,"Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC)."
188,"A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as Connect6, Go-Moku, and Pente."
189,"In Space Base, players assume the roles of Commodores of a small fleet of ships."
189,Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command.
189,Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence.
189,Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence.
189,Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!
189,"Space Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core ""I roll, everyone gets stuff"" mechanism seen in other games."
189,It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board.
189,"The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games."
189,"Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach."
189,"Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices."
190,Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.
190,Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns).
190,"Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs."
190,Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.
190,"The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round."
190,"The game lasts for three ""epochs"" (rounds)."
190,"The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play."
190,"From the Box:
The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!"
190,"The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people."
190,Ra is an auction and set collecting game where players may choose to take risks for great rewards or... And all this is for the glory of the Sun God Ra!
191,"(from GMT Games' website:)
They called it the Great War."
191,"In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age."
191,"The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today."
191,We are all orphans of the Great War.
191,"Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918."
191,As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.'
191,As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.'
191,Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.

(BGG description:)
Following in the footsteps of We the People, Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Successors (First/Second Edition), and For the People, Paths of Glory utilizes a similar card-driven system."
191,The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.
191,"Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening."
191,"While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play."
191,Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.
191,Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.
191,"Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points."
191,The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.
191,How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.
192,Splendor is a game of chip-collecting and card development.
192,"Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops—all in order to acquire the most prestige points."
192,"If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige."
192,"On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card."
192,"If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind."
192,"If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area."
192,"To reserve a card—in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it—you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem."
192,All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points.
192,"In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do."
193,Codenames Duet keeps the basic elements of Codenames — give one-word clues to try to get someone to identify your agents among those on the table — but now you're working together as a team to find all of your agents.
193,(Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)
193,"To set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5×5 grid."

193,"Collectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents — without revealing an assassin — before time runs out in order to win the game."
193,"Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number."
193,Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent.
193,"If correct, they can attempt to identify another one."
193,"If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends."
193,"If they identify an assassin, you both lose!"
193,"Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier."
193,"After the first clue is given, players alternate giving clues."

195,"When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination — single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc."
195,— or pass.
195,"If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one."
195,"The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc."
195,"The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team."
195,"Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses — but the bonuses are what drive the game."
195,"At the start of a round, each player can call ""Tichu"" prior to playing any card."
195,"This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points."
195,"Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call ""Grand Tichu"" after looking at only their first eight cards for a ±200 point bonus."
195,"If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal)."
195,"The first team to 1,000 points wins."

204,Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble).

204,"Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game."
204,"If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins."
204,"If the mastermind completes his scheme, however – having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes – then the players all lose."

205,"If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row."

205,"In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with."

230,"Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them."

234,"From the author:
""Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals."
234,"The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon."
234,"One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England."
234,"The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California."
234,"While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends."
234,"The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century."
234,"""In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War."
234,"However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress."
234,"As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes."
234,"Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind."
234,"""The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960—a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania."
234,"Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon’s lazy shave, President Eisenhower’s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards."
234,The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems.
234,Candidates vie to capture each state’s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country.
234,"At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves."
234,"""As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you."
234,"There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House."
234,"This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads."
234,"Will you recreate history, or rewrite it?"

235,Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism.
235,"Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used."
235,"In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents."
235,"Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool)."
235,Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.
235,There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.
235,"Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment."
235,"Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways."
235,"The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy."
235,Many of the non-English editions use more conventional artwork.
236,"In the village of Tiefenthal lies ""The Tavern of the Deep Valley""."

236,Should you focus on money?
236,Or rather ensure that the beer will keep flowing?
236,"In The Taverns of Tiefenthal, the challenge is to skillfully choose the dice and develop your personal deck of cards as profitably as possible."
236,The game is structured with five modules so that your group can add extra levels of complexity as you become more familiar with the game.

237,"Take to the stars and become a living legend in Star Wars: Outer Rim, a game of bounty hunters, mercenaries, and smugglers for 1-4 players!"
237,"In Outer Rim, you take on the role of an underworld denizen, setting out to make your mark on the galaxy."
237,"You'll travel the outer rim in your personal ship, hire legendary Star Wars characters to join your crew, and try to become the most famous (or infamous) outlaw in the galaxy!"
237,"But it won't be easy since the warring factions of the galaxy roam the outer rim, hunting down the scum that have proven to be a thorn in their side, and other scoundrels looking to make their mark see you as the perfect target to bring down to bolster their own reputation."
237,Do you have what it takes to survive in the outer rim and become a living legend?
237,"In more detail, a game of Outer Rim takes place over a series of turns that sees players taking dangerous jobs, tracking down bounties, upgrading their ship, and more, all in service of gaining more and more fame."
237,"Regardless of the path you take to get there, your goal is to gain ten fame, which can come from a variety of sources, such as completing your character's personal goal, collecting on bounties and jobs, delivering illegal cargo, taking down patrols from the various factions struggling over the galaxy, and enjoying the finer things in life by purchasing luxury items with your hard-earned credits."
237,"While the path to victory may be different for scoundrels finding their way in the Outer Rim, everyone starts from the bottom with a simple starship."
237,"Your player board not only tracks your fame progress, but also contains slots for your ship, your character card, gear, reputation, modifications, jobs, and bounties."
238,"It is the year 2849, and humanity has harnessed the power of the pulsars."
238,Now we must find a way to distribute this power throughout the stars.
238,"In this Euro-style game, players explore space, claim pulsars, and discover technologies that will help them build energy-distribution infrastructure on a cosmic scale."
238,"Dice are used to purchase actions, and players choose their dice from a communal pool."

    □ Develop a Pulsar
    □ Build one or more energy transmitter vectors

239,Preserving a record of your past existence is gravy.)
239,What might keep you from painting that mammoth?
239,"Death, in all its many forms."
239,"Each player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points."
239,"On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location — possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location — and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won't know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can aide someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death."
239,"Life is full of both wonders and terrors...
At the day's end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests."
239,"Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care."
239,"Paleo includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE."
240,"In battle, there are no equals."

240,Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend.

240,"However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time."
240,The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhäuser for ranged attacks and area effects.
240,"The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games."
241,Samurai is set in medieval Japan.
241,"Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan."
241,"The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions — or all three at once!"
241,Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically.
241,"As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group."
241,Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.
241,"At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types."
241,"Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, ""non-majority"" symbols each player has collected."

242,"On November 30, 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from Napoleon."

242,Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey.
242,He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way.
242,"Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance."
242,Lewis & Clark features dual use cards.
242,"To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while."
242,"Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it."
242,"During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly."
242,"This new ""handbuilding"" mechanism fits strongly with the historical background."
242,"Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial."

243,"Journey across islands, building huts where the resilient men and women of your tribes can settle, discovering fishing grounds and collecting shells."
243,"Send priests to the temples, and gather offerings to curry favor with the gods."
243,"In Bora Bora, players use dice to perform a variety of actions using careful insight and tactical planning."
243,"The heart of the game is its action resolution system in which 5-7 actions are available each round, the exact number depending on the number of players."
243,"Each player rolls three dice at the start of the round, then they take turns placing one die at a time on one action."
243,"Place a high number on an action, and you'll generally get a better version of that action: more places to build, more choices of people to take, better positioning on the temple track, and so on."
243,Place a low number and you'll get a worse action – but you'll possibly block other players from taking the action at all as in order to take an action you must place a die on it with a lower number than any die already on the action.
243,"Three task tiles on a player's individual game board provide some direction as to what he might want to do, while god tiles allow for special actions and rule-breaking, as gods are wont to do."
243,The player who best watches how the game develops and uses the most effective strategy will prevail.
244,"As ruler, it's up to you to build the mightiest realm in the world!"
244,Will you choose to follow military tactics and sweep away all in your path with a massive army?

245,"You must explore all the lands, including wheat fields, lakes, and mountains, in order to spot the best plots, while competing with other lords to acquire them first."
245,"The game uses tiles with two sections, similar to Dominoes."
245,"Each turn, each player will select a new domino to connect to their existing kingdom, making sure at least one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play."
245,"The order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen, with better tiles forcing players to pick later in the next round."
245,"The game ends when each player has completed a 5x5 grid (or failed to do so), and points are counted based on number of connecting tiles and valuable crown symbols."
246,"Autumn is not the best time to climb up on a scaffold in Moscow, but it is still far better than doing so in the winter."
246,Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city.
246,We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the government’s trusted workers.
246,Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice.
246,"To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir."
246,"Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock & Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Román (El mundo de Águila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century."
246,"Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game."
246,"The Red Cathedral is a strategic, “Euro” board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams."
246,Their job is to work together to put up St.
246,"Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible."
246,"However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar."
246,"During the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources."
246,Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.
246,When the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section.
246,"The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game."
246,The players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed.
246,When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points.
246,They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar.
246,"This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game."
246,The game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral.
246,"It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market."
246,"In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die."
246,"The Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy."
246,It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.
247,"Dixit Odyssey is both a standalone game and an expansion (Dixit: Odyssey (expansion)) for Jean-Louis Roubira's Dixit, which won Germany's Spiel des Jahres award in 2010."
247,Game play in Dixit Odyssey matches that of Dixit: Each turn one player is the storyteller.
247,"This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card—but not too obviously."
247,Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller.
247,"The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller."
247,"If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller's card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points."
247,Players score one point for each vote their image receives.
247,"Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller."
247,"When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins."
247,"Dixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pierô and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2."
247,"The stand alone version also includes a folding game board, 6 new rabbit scoring tokens (12 total), and a box large enough to hold all the Dixit cards released to date."
247,The stand alone version of Dixit Odyssey includes enough components for up to twelve players and also has variant rules for team play and for new ways to play with the cards.
247,Expansion versus standalone versions of the game.
247,Standalone version is in a square box (released in 2011 but may still be available).

248,"Take your place, wizard!"
248,"Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!"
248,"Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:
The first phase ""Prelude"" consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy."
248,"Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards."
248,"They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards."
248,Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).
248,"These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: 
- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) 
- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards
- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals."
248,"Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end."
248,"- Draw new cards
Each player can choose only one die per turn."
248,"The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the ""time track"" would move forward."
248,"In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season."
248,"For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season."
248,"Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the ""exchange rates"" of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season."
248,"At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable)."
248,The highest score wins.

249,"Possible actions include: move on the map (how far depends on whether they have a mount), doing a location-specific action (such as mine for gold if they are at a gold mine, gamble if they're in a saloon, etc."
249,"), fight other players at the same location (either duel them, rob them, or arrest them if they're wanted), play poker cards that have action abilities, etc."

250,Power Grid deluxe: Europe/North America is a standalone game in the Power Grid universe.
250,For the expansion to regular Power Grid see Power Grid: Europe/North America.
250,For the 10th anniversary of the highly successful game Power Grid we present this new deluxe version including brand new components.
250,"Wait for a huge double-sided game board presenting Europe and North America, newly customized wooden parts and an entire deck of new power plants, some of which use natural gas instead of garbage."
250,New overview cards for the resource refill improve game play.
250,An exciting new two players experience is also added - “Against the Trust”!
250,"The game is still Power Grid, with all the exciting auctions, the nerve-wracking resource speculations, city networks and the competition among the players, all the way to the tight game ending with several players fighting for the win."
250,The goal of Power Grid Deluxe is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network reaches a predetermined size.
250,"Players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they need to power these cities."
250,"However, as power plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment."
250,"What's more, players must acquire the resources (coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the ""renewable"" windfarm plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes."
250,"NOTE: The deluxe edition came with Power Grid: The New Power Plants – Set 2, which was later released separately in 2021."
251,The KLASK game board is shaped like a ball field with two deep holes functioning as goals in each end of the field.
251,"In the middle of the field, three white magnetic pieces serve as ""obstacles"" – do NOT attract them to your own gaming piece!"
251,Your gaming piece is a black magnet.
251,You control it by holding a large magnet under the board.
251,This magnet is connected to a small magnet placed on the field.
251,"The purpose of the game is to push the small, red ball around on the field with your magnet/gaming piece, shoot the ball past the obstacles and your opponent and into the goal hole (Klask)."
251,It’s so much fun when your opponent suddenly is covered in white obstacles or you drop your gaming piece into the goal – something which might happen if you get a little too eager!
251,Place the game board on a table between the two players.
251,Place the three white magnetic pieces on the white fields on the board.
251,"Put two coins in each point slot next to the ""0""."
251,Each player has a black magnetic gaming piece in two parts.
251,"Place the short (thin) part on top of the board and the long (thick) part under the board in such a way, so the two parts “catch” each other."
251,Place the ball in the corner start field.
251,Steer it with the black gaming pieces.
251,The youngest player starts the game.
251,"You score a point if:

The ball ends in your opponent's hole and stays in the hole."
251,Two or all of the three white magnetic pieces stick to your opponent's gaming piece.
251,The opponent accidentally pulls their gaming piece into their own goal hole.
251,If the opponent loses their gaming piece.
251,"Each time you get a point, you must move your coin one point forward in the point slot."
251,The player who first reaches the KLASK field wins.
251,"During the game:

If one of the white magnetic pieces sticks to a gaming piece, the game continues; if two of the white magnetic pieces stick to one gaming piece, the opponent gets one point."
251,"If the ball falls over the edges of the board, you must place the ball in the corner start field in the half from which the ball fell."
251,"If one or more white magnetic pieces fall over the edges of the board, the game continues."
251,"Each time a player scores a point, you must put the white magnetic pieces back on the white fields on the board, and the player who did not score a point places the ball in their corner start field."
252,Welcome to the Rococo era during the reign of Louis XV when it’s safe to say that holding lavish balls is quite trendy.
252,"Important personalities wrap up in noble coats and dresses, anxious to outshine one another."
252,"As the biggest event is coming up in just a few weeks, everyone is turning to you with their requests: an elegant coat here, a stunning dress there, or a donation to fund the fireworks at the event."
252,Soon you realize that it’s not just about your dressmaking business anymore — it’s about managing the most prestigious ball of the era…and now it’s time to ro(c)k!
252,Rokoko is a Eurostyle board game with an interesting take on deck-building.
252,"Each turn you play one of your employee cards and let that employee perform a task: hire a new employee, buy resources, manufacture a coat or dress, or invest in the ball’s decorations."
252,"But not every employee is up to every task, so you must choose and lead your employees wisely — especially since each employee grants a unique bonus and some of these bonuses generate prestige points."
252,"After seven rounds, the game ends with the big ball and a final scoring."
252,Then you gain prestige points for certain employee bonuses and for coats and dresses that you rent out to guests at the ball as well as for decorations that you funded.
252,The player who collected the most prestige points wins.
253,"From the rulebook:
Europe in the age of imperialism."
253,International investors try to achieve the greatest influence in Europe.
253,"With their bonds, they control the politics of the six imperial nations: Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, Great Britain, the German Empire, and Russia."
253,"The nations erect factories, build fleets, and deploy armies."
253,"The investors watch as their nations expand, wage wars, levy taxes, and collect the proceeds."
253,"Since the European nations are under the shifting influence of different investors, new strategic alliances and conflicts arise between them again and again!"
253,Each player represents an international investor.
253,Only he who succeeds in increasing his capital and gaining influence in the most powerful European nations will win the imperial competition.
253,Imperial is a varied strategy game without the luck of dice or cards.
253,"Two to six players, from about twelve years and up, take on the role of imperial investors."
253,The duration of the game is about two to three hours.
254,Tapestry is a two-hour game for 1-5 players designed by Jamey Stegmaier.
254,"Create the civilization with the most storied history, starting at the beginning of humankind and reaching into the future."
254,The paths you choose will vary greatly from real-world events or people — your civilization is unique!
254,"In Tapestry, you start from nothing and advance on any of the four advancement tracks (science, technology, exploration, and military) to earn progressively better benefits."
254,You can focus on a specific track or take a more balanced approach.
254,"You will also improve your income, build your capital city, leverage your asymmetric abilities, earn victory points, and gain tapestry cards that will tell the story of your civilization."

255,Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags.
255,"Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc)."
255,The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.
255,This is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.
255,"Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an ""advanced variant""."
255,Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.
255,"Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores."
255,In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher.
256,"Play as a god of ancient Egypt, competing to survive as society begins to forget the old ways, so that only you and your followers remain."
256,"Build caravans, summon monsters, and convert followers in your quest to reign supreme in Ankh: Gods of Egypt."
256,"Deities, monsters, and the people of ancient Egypt have been lovingly reimagined and interpreted in beautiful illustrations and detailed miniatures, and players will truly feel like gods as they shake the very foundations of Egypt."
256,"All gameplay in Ankh, including combat, is streamlined and non-random."
256,Compete and win solely on your godly wits alone.
256,—description from the publisher
257,Become the leader of an imp family that has just started a new business – breeding and selling petz.
257,Sound simple and safe?
257,"Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords."
257,"This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop."

268,"And a costly one at that, too."
268,He has paid way too much for merging his rubber company with the Sultan’s extensive rubber plantations: there are no ships in the area to transport the rubber to the booming cities of Java.
268,And the Sultan is now dripping in cash — he can bribe city authorities so that his ships will gain preferential access to those ports where they are competing.

301,The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.
301,Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964.
301,"3M actually received the idea for the game of ""Vacations"" from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called ""ACQUIRE."""
301,3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE.
301,They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright.
301,These games had Sid's original rules.
301,"When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had taken liberties with some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires."

304,"Bärenpark takes you into the world of bears, challenging you to build your own bear park."
304,Would you like another polar bear enclosure or rather a koala* house?
304,"The park visitors are sure to get hungry on their tour through the park, so build them places to eat!"
304,"Whatever your choices are, make sure you get the next building permit and use your land wisely!"
304,"(* No, koalas aren't bears but they're so cute, we couldn't leave them out of this game!)"
304,"In more detail, each player in Bärenpark builds their own bear park, attempting to make it as beautiful as they can, while also using every square meter possible."
304,"The park is created by combining polyomino tiles onto a grid, with players scoring for animal houses, outdoor areas, completed construction, and more."
304,"The sooner you build it, the better!"
304,Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections.
304,"The game ends as soon as one player has finished expanding their park, then players tally their points to see who has won."
304,—description from the publisher
305,"Get ready to enter the poor and dreary Whitechapel district in London 1888 – the scene of the mysterious Jack the Ripper murders – with its crowded and smelly alleys, hawkers, shouting merchants, dirty children covered in rags who run through the crowd and beg for money, and prostitutes – called ""the wretched"" – on every street corner."
305,"The board game Letters from Whitechapel, which plays in 90-150 minutes, takes the players right there."
305,"One player plays Jack the Ripper, and his goal is to take five victims before being caught."
305,The other players are police detectives who must cooperate to catch Jack the Ripper before the end of the game.
305,The game board represents the Whitechapel area at the time of Jack the Ripper and is marked with 199 numbered circles linked together by dotted lines.
305,"During play, Jack the Ripper, the Policemen, and the Wretched are moved along the dotted lines that represent Whitechapel's streets."
305,"Jack the Ripper moves stealthily between numbered circles, while policemen move on their patrols between crossings, and the Wretched wander alone between the numbered circles."
306,Merchants & Marauders lets you live the life of an influential merchant or a dreaded pirate in the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy.
306,"Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering."
306,"Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members."
306,Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?
306,"In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean."
306,"The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 ""glory"" points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship."
306,"While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed."
306,Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.
306,"A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn ""pirate"" or remain as a trader or neutral party."
306,Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.
306,"Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat."
307,"In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland."
307,"He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary séance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery."
307,"Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards."
307,The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime?
307,Where did it take place?
307,Which weapon caused the death?
307,"The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit."
307,"In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium."
307,"To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder."
307,"A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium."
307,"Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards."
307,"These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received."
307,"Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer."
307,"Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses."
307,"After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not."
307,"Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect."
307,"Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock."
307,They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.
307,"If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved."
307,"If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit."
307,"Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group."
307,"The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards — one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon — then shuffles these cards."
307,"Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote."
307,"If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully."
307,"If not, well, perhaps you can try again..."
308,What would it be like for Mages of vastly different schools and philosophies of magic to come together in an arena and fight to the death?
308,How would an Illusionist battle a Druid?
308,Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster?
308,Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?
308,Mage Wars — redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy — pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat.
308,Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent.
308,"Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts – all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!"
308,"Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre."
308,"The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called ""zones"", which regulate movement and the placement of objects."
308,"Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy."
308,"Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game."
308,"This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn."
308,"A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points."
308,"You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics."
308,"Many of these spells – such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments – are placed on the board and become objects in the game."
308,"Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage."
308,"Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc."
308,"Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures."
308,"Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:

The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments."
308,"The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor."
308,"Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures."
308,"The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana."
308,He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.
308,The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells.
308,"She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end."
308,"The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc."
308,"New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game."
308,"The game is NOT collectible, but is fully customizable!"
308,"Extra copies of spells available with:

Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 1
Mage Wars: Core Spell Tome 2"

309,You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.

309,"expansions, available here on BGG."
309,Note:  All base game and expansion armies in all versions/editions are functionally compatible!

309,There is no need to post another thread asking about this...
309,Note:  There is no solitaire bot/AI/system to compete against.
309,"The only options for ""solo"" play are soloing multiple factions yourself, or solving puzzles (like Chess checkmate problems) available in some editions and expansions."
310,"2010 Spiel des Jahres Winner
One player is the storyteller for the turn and looks at the images on the 6 cards in her hand."
310,"From one of these, she makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players)."
310,"Each other player selects the card in their hands which best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others."
310,The storyteller shuffles her card with all the received cards.
310,All pictures are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which picture was the storyteller's.

310,Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3.
310,Players score 1 point for every vote for their own card.

311,"With technology rapidly developing and the human population growing, Victorian-era Earth is in dire need of fuel, land, and other natural resources."
311,"Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found."
311,"More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality."
311,"As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy – if you can reach them before your competitors."
311,"You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible."
311,At your command is a team of nine professionals.
311,"Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch."
311,"In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round."
311,"Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find."
311,"Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end."
311,"During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars."
311,"The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:

313,"During a turn, you ask for information about two different references in which you are interested."
313,"The rest of the players can offer you cards that contain the requested references, and you can trade for those cards by giving the offering players the same number of points they have offered via cards in your hand."

315,"For the second round, clue givers can only say one word."

315,Based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.
316,The Empire must fall.
316,Our mission must succeed.
316,"By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people."
316,"Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage."
316,We must unmask them.
316,In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying.
316,We are the Resistance!
316,The Resistance is a party game of social deduction.
316,"It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination."
316,"The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination."

316,"When a team wins three missions, they have won the game."
316,"Rule Correction:
For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: ""Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards."""
316,"and ""...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)"" - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings."
317,"A long time ago at the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor offered a giant panda bear as a symbol of peace to the Japanese Emperor."
317,"Since then, the Japanese Emperor has entrusted his court members (the players) with the difficult task of caring for the animal by tending to his bamboo garden."
317,"In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow, and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden."
317,They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo.
317,"The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game."
318,Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is a new take on Uwe Rosenberg's Agricola designed for exactly two players and focused only on the animal husbandry aspect of that game.

318,"Sixteen possible actions are available for players to take, with each player taking three actions total in each of the eight rounds."
318,The player who amasses the most victory points through enclosing space with fences and acquiring the largest number and variety of animals and victory point-generating buildings will be the winner.
318,Four Standard Buildings and 4 special buildings are available in the base game.
318,These buildings each provide unique special abilities during play and/or VP at game end.
318,Balancing the tension between building infrastructure (fenced pastures and buildings) and acquiring animals (the single biggest source of end-game scoring) is the key to success!
319,Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell – Wu-Feng – and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life.
319,Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.
319,"The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game."
319,"At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time."
319,"The ghosts all have abilities of their own – some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action."
319,"On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted."
319,Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus.
319,"With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc."
319,It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.
319,"To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white."
319,"If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds."
319,The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color.
319,"For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both."
319,"If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll."
319,You may choose to use these after your roll.
319,Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts.
319,One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.
319,"To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game."
319,"There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them."
319,"There are many more ways to lose, however."
319,"The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead."
320,Massive Star Destroyers fly to battle against Rebel corvettes and frigates.
320,Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs.
320,Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields.
320,Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield.
320,Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.
320,"In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance."
320,You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy.
320,"Using the game’s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them."
320,"Then, as these ships exchange fire, it’s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy."
320,"Maneuver Tool
The maneuver tool is one of the game’s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars."
320,"It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship's course."
320,More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.
320,"Command Stack
Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy’s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences."
320,"Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they’re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can’t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle."
320,"Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead."
320,You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.
320,"Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time."
320,"During setup, you secretly build your initial command stack, selecting from any of four different commands, each of which provides a different advantage."
320,"Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice."
320,"Then, during each round of game play, you secretly select and assign a new command to your ship, placing it at the bottom of your command stack, before you reveal the command at the top of your stack and gain its benefits."
321,"For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate."
321,"During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible."
321,"The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30."
321,"The Überplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players."
321,"The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the Überplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art."
321,"The rules are the same as the Überplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the Überplay edition)."
321,"Rounding rule
The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here."
321,A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here.
322,Meadow is an engaging set collection game with over two hundred unique cards containing hand-painted watercolor illustrations.

322,"To win, they collect cards with the most valuable species, landscapes, and discoveries."
322,"Their journey is led by passion, a curiosity of the world, an inquiring mind, and a desire to discover the mysteries of nature."
322,The competition continues at the bonfire where the players race to fulfill the goals of their adventures.
322,"In this medium-weight board game for 1-4 players, you take turns placing path tokens on one of the two boards."
322,"Placing a token on the main board allows the player to get cards, but playing them requires meeting certain requirements."
322,Playing a token on the bonfire board activates special actions (which helps to implement a chosen strategy) and gives the opportunity to achieve goals that provide additional points.
322,"Throughout the game, players collect cards in their meadow and surroundings area."
322,"At the end, the player with the most points on cards and on the bonfire board wins."
322,Meadow also includes envelopes with additional cards to open at specific moments...

324,"Altiplano is a bag-building game along the lines of Orléans, set in the South American highlands of the Andes (the ""Altiplano"")."
324,"The competition for limited resources is considerable, as it was in Orléans, but the greater focus in Altiplano is on building up your own production to be the best that it can be - or at least better than that of the other players!"
324,"Each player starts with a unique role tile, giving them access to different goods and methods of production."
324,"Players have limited access to production at the start, but they can acquire additional production sites during the game that open up new options."
324,"The various types of goods — such as fish, alpaca, cacao, silver and corn — all have their own characteristics and places where they can be used."
324,"For example, while silver can be sold for a high price at the market, fish can be exchanged for other goods at the harbor and alpaca can produce wool at the farm that can then be made into cloth."
324,"Aside from building up an effective production, players must fulfill their orders at the right time, develop the road in good time and store their goods cleverly enough to fill their warehouses in the most valuable way."
324,"Often, a good warehouse keeper is more relevant in the end than the best producer."
325,The world you know no longer exists.
325,There is no government.

325,"To do this, every card in 51st State can be used in three different ways:

Raze a location to gain many resources once."
325,Deal with this location to gain one resource every turn.
325,Build the location so that you can use its skill each turn.
325,"51st State: Master Set marks the rebirth of the 51st State line, with this set containing 88 cards from the original base game, and 50 cards each from both the New Era and Winter expansions; one of these expansions can be mixed with the cards of the base game, but not both at the same time."
325,The entire set has been rebalanced to offer a cohesive experience no matter which expansion you choose to use.

327,Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra.
327,"Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as ""The Most Select of Places"" (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world."
327,"Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt."
327,"Join ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris."
327,"You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat."
327,"The game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris."
327,In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board.
327,"As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment."
327,"As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark."
327,The game takes place over multiple rounds.
327,"Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted."
327,"Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow."
327,"While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted."
327,"As you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice — if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section — but also which value die to draft."
327,"You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order."
327,"When you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from."
327,"Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris."
327,"Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!"
327,"Two scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources."
327,"However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences."
328,Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series.
328,"The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2–10 in five different colors with three special ""handshakes"" (""HS"" in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay."
328,A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.
328,The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards.
328,"On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile."
328,"Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive."
328,Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition.
328,"Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3."
328,The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck.
328,The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions.
328,Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored.
328,"Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it."
328,"Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit."
328,"If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies."
328,A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it.
328,"A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together."
328,"Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30."
328,This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.
328,"Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40."
328,"This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, ×3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards."
328,"Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17."
328,"This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, ×2 for the multiplier."
329,Nusfjord is a tranquil fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway.
329,"Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning."
329,"Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there."
329,Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses.
329,Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.
329,"In the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different."
329,Sailing ships dominate the fjord.
329,The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees.
329,"As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders."
329,"Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep."
329,"As with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions."
329,"Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space — which is possible only if room is available for this worker."
329,"Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market."
329,"This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea."
329,"The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty."
330,Evolution: Climate is a standalone game that introduces climate into the Evolution game system.
330,"In Evolution: Climate, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce, predators lurk, and the climate can swing between scorching hot and icy cold."
330,Traits like a Hard Shell and Horns can protect your species from Carnivores while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach.
330,Heavy Fur and Migratory can protect your species from the cold while being Nocturnal or Burrowing will provide protection from the cruel desert sun.
330,"With over 200,000 ways to evolve your species, every game evolves into a different adventure."
330,"The Climate standalone game dramatically changes game play with several simple additions to the Evolution base set:

 Players draw 4 cards +1 per species per round (instead of 3 cards + 1 per species)."
330,Each species may have up to 4 traits (instead of 3).
330,The climate moves along a Climate Track based upon the food cards played each round.
330,There are additional trait cards that provide protection from the heat and cold.
330,"Evolution: Climate changes Evolution from a two-dimensional game (dealing with the threat of Starvation and Carnivores) into a three-dimensional game (dealing with the threat of Starvation, Carnivores, and Climate effects) while increasing the vividness of the theme."
330,It adds additional layers into what was already a dynamically strategic game.
331,"The bonfires are sources of light, energy and warmth created by the guardians of light in order to brighten the cities on the otherwise dark planet."
331,"The residents of the cities however, took the bonfires for granted and exploited them for their personal gain."
331,Disappointed the guardians of light retreated and let the bonfires extinguish.
331,The citizens could no longer live in the now dark cities and were forced to leave.
331,You are a group of gnomes living close to the cities and you also need and the light of the bonfires.
331,"Missing it now, you try yourself to visit the cities and learn how to ignite the bonfires once again: You must visit the guardians of light on their holy islands and ask for tasks to prove your good will."
331,"For each completed task, they will re-ignite one extinguished bonfire."
331,Whoever manages to earn the greatest trust from the guardians and manages to brighten their city the most will win the game.
331,The engine for Bonfire are the three-coloured tiles you will be puzzling onto your player board.
331,"When you manage to place the same colours adjacent to one another, you will receive more action tiles of that specific kind."
331,This will allow you to specialize in certain types of actions and pursue different strategies.
331,"You can use the tiles to perform the following actions: 
- Move your ship to an island 
- Receive a task from an island by spending two resources 
- Invite a guardian of light into your city 
- Trigger a procession of guardians through your city and gain resources."
331,"- Add a landscape tile to your city (this is where the processions take place) 
- Recruit a gnome gaining a special ability or victory points 
- Find support by the last bonfire, gaining portals, resources or action tiles
You will play in turn order until a fixed number of tasks has been solved, after which each player has 5 more turns."
331,"During final scoring, you will receive points for your completed tasks (the bonfires) and any improvements made there (portals, landscapes or guardians)."

332,San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico.
332,"The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and ""violet"" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points."
332,"Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down."
332,A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.
332,"In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings."
332,"The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply."
332,"Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms."
332,"In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked."
332,"Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings."
333,"Rio Grande Games' description:
The players take on the roles of the heads of influential families in Paris at the end of the 14th century."
333,"In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation."
333,Each family controls one of the 3–5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame.
333,"As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough."

333,Players play as well-off Parisians in the 14th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral.
333,"The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter."
333,"However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications."
333,"If one does one thing, then the other can't be done."
333,"Concentrating on one aspect means automatically ignoring another, which, above all others, is particularly dangerous in the case of the gradually approaching plague...
After 9 exciting rounds and about 75 action-filled minutes, Notre Dame is over."
333,The maitre who has made the most of his cards and has garnered the most prestige points is the winner.

344,"Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well!"
344,"To win, you must score achievements, which you can attain by amassing points or by meeting certain criteria with the innovations you have built."
344,"Plan your civilization well, and outmaneuver your opponents, and with some luck you will achieve victory!"
345,The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa.
345,"It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa."
345,"Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin."
345,"But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage."
345,"As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork."
345,"In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice."
345,"They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game."
345,Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region.
345,"Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice."
345,"Here's the flavour text from the rules:
The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle."
345,"“Oondabezitha ”, he addresses the assembly of kings, “I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight”."
345,The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks.
345,The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending.
345,They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves.
345,"“Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala”, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders."
345,“The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high.
345,Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own”.
345,Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly.
345,The men scramble while the plains fill with water.
345,The ceremony will be wet tonight...
345,The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.
345,"Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'."
345,But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments.
345,"The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game."
345,"If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points."
345,"Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart!"
345,"'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed."
345,Then other players' decisions change everything...
346,"Destinies is a competitive, story-driven, game of adventure and exploration, mixing an app and a board game."
346,The first in a series of games using a brand-new system called Destinies.
346,This game is set in a dark medieval-fantasy universe.
346,"The Destinies system offers a fully story-driven, app-supported, RPG-like board game experience, without the need for a game master."
346,"Each scenario depicts a part of a vivid world, full of dark stories, epic NPCs and mysteries to solve."
346,Each player takes the role of a hero on a quest to fulfill their destiny.
346,"Each destiny is a final goal of the character and has at least two, completely different paths to victory, composed of branching series of quests."
346,Players compete with each other to push the world towards their own destiny.
346,"The game uses an app and the Scan&Play technology to offer players a unique story-driven experience full of dynamic events, epic adventures, and an ever-changing game world."
346,"Each turn players discover new parts of the world presented on tiles, explore them and pick one point of interest to visit."
346,"There they learn more about the story and make crucial choices of how they want to interact with people, creatures or situations faced there."
346,The consequences of each choice are meaningful and often change the state of the world forever.

347,"In Anno 1800, a board game based on the popular PC game from Ubisoft, you continuously build up your own industry to develop your home island."
347,Ship fleets allow for lively trade and the development of new islands in the Old and New World.
347,You have to fulfill the wishes of your own population.
347,"While the inhabitants are initially satisfied with bread and clothing, they soon demand valuable luxury goods."
347,You must plan production chains sensibly and keep an eye on the specialization of your population.
347,"The goal: A wise distribution of farmers, workers, craftsmen, engineers, and investors — but the competition never sleeps and can snatch the new achievements from under your nose at any time!"
347,Who can create the most prosperous island?

348,It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in.
348,"Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests."
348,The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!
348,"You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your
influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world."
348,"Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you."
348,The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire.
348,"Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles."
348,"Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world."
348,"The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!"
348,"Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track."
348,They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track.
348,"During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw."
348,Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions.
348,"Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens."
348,"Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region."
348,"Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent!"
348,"Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player."
348,Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track.
348,A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw.
348,"Once all players have passed, a new round begins."
349,"On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building in Saint Petersburg."
349,"Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (bringing victory points) may want to move in."
349,"But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can provide the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over."
349,"The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose."
349,Saint Petersburg has a board to tally victory points and to set out the four types of cards.
349,It is the cards themselves that players need to collect.
349,"In each round – with the number of rounds dependent on the number of players and the randomness of card availability – players first pay for CRAFTSMEN who supply money for further purchases; then BUILDINGS to score points; then ARISTOCRATS, who are needed for money, points, and end-of-game scoring; and finally, unique cards from all three categories which give greater benefits."
349,"During the first rounds, players never have enough money to buy every card they want."
349,"During later rounds, they have plenty of money, but the cards they'd like to buy may have already come and gone..."
349,"Expanded by:

Sankt Petersburg: Das Bankett

350,The middle of the 17th century was a period of great changes; with the advent of the scientific method came what we now call the Scientific Revolution.
350,"Many great scientists, with their theories and ideas, changed and shaped our perception of the universe: Galileo Galilei, Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon and, above all, Sir Isaac Newton."
350,"In Newton, the players take the role of a young scientist who wants to become one of the great geniuses of this era."
350,"To reach their ultimate goal, they travel around Europe, visit universities and cities, study to discover new theories, build new tools and work to earn money."
350,The game is played over six rounds.
350,"Each round, every player plays five cards from their hand, and each played card allows the player to perform one of the many actions of the game."
350,"An action can have a variety of effects, which depend on the symbols on the board."
350,"At the end of the round, a player can take back all the cards except for one."
350,"One card has to remain on the board, which means that you give up one possibility of doing that action, but also that that very action will be carried out with greater strength."
350,"Fortunately, you can acquire new cards with additional powers to perform more actions."
350,"After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins."
350,"The New Edition includes:
- Newton: Great Discoveries Expansion
- Newton: Robert Hooke Promo Card
- Newton: Stephen Hawking Promo Card
Any other promos are not included."

351,Bruxelles 1893 is a worker placement game with elements of bidding and majority control.
351,"Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style."
351,The most successful building yields the most points.
351,Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.
351,"The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn."
351,"Some actions cost money – acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige – while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost."
351,"Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works."
351,"After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board."
351,"After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand."
351,The player with the most points wins.
352,"The Abyss power is once again vacant, so the time has come to get your hands on the throne and its privileges."
352,Use all of your cunning to win or buy votes in the Council.
352,Recruit the most influential Lords and abuse their powers to take control of the most strategic territories.
352,"Finally, impose yourself as the only one able to rule the Abyssal people!"
352,"Abyss is a game of development, combination and collection in which players try to take control of strategic locations in an underwater city."
352,"To achieve this, players must develop on three levels: first by collecting allies, then using them to recruit Lords of the Abyss, who will then grant access to different parts of the city."
352,"Players acquire cards through a draft of sorts, and the Lords of the Abyss acquired on those cards grant special powers to the cardholder — but once you use the cards to acquire a location, that power is shut off, so players need to time their land grabs well in order to put themselves in the best position for when the game ends."
353,Stefan Feld's 3rd game by Alea is In the Year of the Dragon.
353,Players take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000.
353,"The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse."
353,"Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor."
353,The game play is easier than it may appear.
353,"Every player has a set of ""person"" cards."
353,"Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) to help you prepare for the months ahead."
353,"Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces."
353,Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year.
353,"(Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.)"
353,"At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points."
353,"Careful planning is the key to surviving ""the year of the dragon,"" but survival alone may not win you the game."
354,"The King's Dilemma is an interactive narrative experience with legacy elements, featuring several branching storylines leading to many possible finales and an evolving deck of event cards at its core."
354,Players represent the various houses leading the government of the Kingdom of Ankist.
354,"You will draw one card from the ""Dilemma deck"" each round and experience the game story as it unfolds."
354,Each card poses a problem that the Council has to resolve on the King's behalf.
354,"As members of the King's inner circle, your decisions determine how the story proceeds and the fate of the kingdom."
354,"Each event happens only once: You discuss and bargain with the other players, then finally you make a choice, determining the outcome, progressing the game story, and possibly unlocking more events."
354,"You have to keep the kingdom going, while also seeking an advantage for your own house; this power struggle may lead the kingdom into war, famine, or riot, or it could generate wealth and well-being."
354,This will depend on your choices!
354,"The thing is, each decision has consequences, and what is good for the kingdom as a whole may be bad for your family...
Will you act for the greater good, or will you think only of yourself?"
355,This is a negotiation game in the truest sense of the word.
355,"In it, players acquire ownership of sections of city blocks then place tiles, representing businesses, onto the block-sections."
355,"At the end of each turn, each tile you've laid gives you some sort of payout, but completed businesses (formed of three to six connected tiles of the same type) pay quite a bit better."
355,"All these resources are dealt to the players randomly, however, so players must trade to get matching businesses and adjacent locations."
355,This game is #2 in the Alea big box series.
356,"Hera, tired of Zeus' infidelity, decides to take her revenge and releases the Titans on Mount Olympus."
356,"In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth."
356,"In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being."
356,The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely.
356,"As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world."
356,"As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves."
356,"They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal."
356,"Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image."
356,"The world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland."
356,"Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory."
356,But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms.
356,The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx.
356,"Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however...
Hades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld."
356,"The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface."
356,"As a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power."
356,"In Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game."
356,"Choose your God, draft your warband and take the fight to your enemies with the might of the most powerful beings from Greek mythology at your back."

358,"In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens—all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo."
358,"At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack."
358,"Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory."
358,"The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters alone!"
358,"Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!"
358,"In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended."
358,First Game in the King of Tokyo series
359,High-stakes bidding on million-dollar race cars.
359,Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track.
359,"And to the victor, the biggest purse of all."
359,"But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead."
359,"Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer."
359,"Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track."
359,"However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars."
359,So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory.
359,"Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race."
359,"Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins."
359,This is a game whose design needed no attention.
359,Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection.
359,"On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version."
359,Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability.
359,"But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play."
359,"Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more."
360,Ticket to Ride: Märklin is the third installment in Days of Wonder's best-selling Ticket to Ride series.
360,The board for Märklin is based on a map of Germany and each individual card in the deck depicts a different Märklin Trains model.
360,A DVD introducing players to the Märklin line of model trains is included [Edit: DVD no longer included in recent runs.]
360,"Märklin is a heavier version in the TTR series, allowing players to not only travel from city to city but also from cities to countries."
360,A new mechanic is also introduced in the form of passengers and merchandise tokens.
360,When the game is set-up a series of merchandise values worth victory points are placed on nominated cities.
360,"The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens."
360,"These tokens can be collected by the players by placing their Passengers (3 per player), which can be achieved at the end of a turn in which a player lays trains to enter the city in question."
360,Once a passenger is in play a player can forfeit their regular turn to move a passenger.
360,Moving along a player's own train network comes at no cost and allows a player to take the top merchandise token from each city that is passed through.
360,A passenger can also move along sections of track featuring other players trains but a passenger card must be paid each time this occurs to do so.
360,The player who completes the most destination tickets receives a 10 point bonus (instead of the base game's longest route bonus).
361,You are the mayor of a tiny town in the forest in which the smaller creatures of the woods have created a civilization hidden away from predators.
361,"This new land is small and the resources are scarce, so you take what you can get and never say no to building materials."
361,"Cleverly plan and construct a thriving town, and don't let it fill up with wasted resources!"
361,Whoever builds the most prosperous tiny town wins!
361,"In Tiny Towns, your town is represented by a 4x4 grid on which you will place resource cubes in specific layouts to construct buildings."
361,Each building scores victory points (VPs) in a unique way.
361,"When no player can place any more resources or construct any buildings, the game ends, and any squares without a building are worth -1 VP."
361,The player with the most VP wins!

362,"At the height of its power, the Roman Empire held more than two million square miles of territory containing over a hundred million people."
362,"Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature."
362,"By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire."
362,"This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover."
362,"Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire."
362,"Combining the cooperative gameplay of Pandemic with innovative new mechanisms, Pandemic: Fall of Rome takes players back in history to the time of the world's greatest empire: Rome."
362,"A weakened military has left the borders open to invasion from countless tribes such as the Anglo-Saxons, Goths, Vandals, and Huns."
362,"As you march through the Roman Empire, you must recruit armies, fortify cities, forge alliances, and face off against the invading hordes in battle."
362,Simply defending Rome is not enough; players must find a way to stop the incursions and find peace with their neighboring peoples.
362,Players collect sets of matching-colored cards to forge an alliance with the different tribes.
362,"In doing so, they gain the ability to use cards matching the tribe to convert other members of that tribe into Roman soldiers, furthering their ability to hold the line against other invaders."
362,Take on unique roles with special abilities to improve your team's chances to protect against the invaders.
362,"Work together, use your skills wisely, and stop the fall of Rome!"
362,Pandemic: Fall of Rome includes a solitaire mode in which the player takes on the burden of being the Emperor and commands three different roles to try to protect the city from the invading hordes.
362,"Players who want a more difficult game can try the ""Roma Caput Mundi"" challenge by adding more Revolt cards to the deck; they must also respect the law in Rome that Roman legions are not allowed in the city."

363,"2212: Ginkgo Biloba, the oldest and strongest tree in the world, has become the symbol of a new method for building cities in symbiosis with nature."
363,"Humans have exhausted the resources that the Earth offered them, and humanity must now develop cities that maintain a delicate balance between resource production and consumption."
363,"Habitable space is scarce, however, and mankind must now face the challenge of building ever upwards."
363,"To develop this new type of city, you will gather a team of experts around you, and try to become the best urban planner for Ginkgopolis."
363,"In  Ginkgopolis, the city tiles come in three colors: yellow, which provides victory points; red, which provides resources; and blue, which provides new city tiles."
363,"Some tiles start in play, and they're surrounded by letter markers that show where new tiles can be placed."
363,"On a turn, each player chooses a card from his hand simultaneously."
363,"Players reveal these cards, adding new tiles to the border of the city in the appropriate location or placing tiles on top of existing tiles."
363,"Each card in your hand that you don't play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!"
363,"When you add a new tile to the city, you take a ""power"" card of the same color, and these cards provide you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts."
364,"Designer Eric Lang, known for his ""dudes on a map"" games, describes The Godfather: Corleone's Empire — a standalone big box board game with high-quality miniatures — as ""thugs on a map""."
364,"In short, the game is a streamlined, confrontational worker placement game filled with murder and intrigue."
364,"You play as competing mafia families who are vying for economic control of the organized crime networks of New York City, deploying your thugs, your don, your wife, and your heir on the board to shake down businesses and engage in area-control turf wars."
364,"Money, rackets, contracts, and special advantages (such as the union boss) are represented by cards in your hand, and your hand size is limited, with you choosing which extra cards to pay tribute to the don at the end of each of the five rounds."
364,"At the end of the game, though, cash is all that matters, and whoever has the most money wins."
364,The game also features drive-by shootings in which enemy tokens are removed from the board and placed face-down in the river.
365,"Maria is a game based on the War of the Austrian Succession, where Austria was attacked by Prussia, France, Bavaria and Saxony, while only Great Britain, Hanover and the Netherlands (by forming the so-called Pragmatic Army) helped her."
365,Maria is primarily a 3 player game.
365,"One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria's enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria's ally) at the same time."
365,"This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map."
365,"Maria is derived from the award-winning Friedrich, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony's betrayal and Prussia's annexation of Silesia."
365,"Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory."
365,"However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin."
365,Maria takes you to the era of the 18th century's ruthless struggle for power.
365,"It can be played in 2 variants: the shorter, simplified introductory game or the longer but richer advanced game, with its simultaneous campaigns in Bohemia and Flanders."
366,"Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: Jack the Ripper & West End Adventures is a standalone expansion to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective with updated graphics that features ten more cases to be solved in Sherlock Holmes' Victorian-era London, England."

370,San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico.
370,"The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and ""violet"" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points."
370,"Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down."
370,A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.
370,"In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings."
370,"The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply."
370,"Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms."
370,"In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked."
370,"Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings."
370,This second edition of San Juan includes all the cards of the original game as well as the additional building cards from the alea Treasure Chest but not the event cards from that expansion.
370,"This edition also contains a new building card not previously available: ""The Hut,"" a building that grants a card when nothing is sold in the trader phase."

371,Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.
371,"Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest."
371,"Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players."
371,"Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization."
371,It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win.

372,"The foundations of the big Zaibatsu were the traditional silk workshops, but soon the conglomerates diversified their influence and power, building a complex structure of interconnected companies that made them giant players in the world’s new industrial era."
372,Each player takes the reins of one of these big corporations and tries to develop it in order to grow and achieve power.

376,"Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the board game is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations."
376,"Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space."
376,"Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing."
376,Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune.
376,Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game.
376,"Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces."

378,Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham.
378,"Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds."
378,These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.
378,Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror.
378,Will they Prevail?
378,Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.

379,"Also included are character boards, counters and markers, and dice."
379,"One player controls a small group of determined humans, while the other plays an almost unending army of demonic creatures."
379,"The game is thematic and highly asymmetric: human characters are stronger, but the demon characters are more numerous."
379,"Gameplay is very straightforward with a minimum of rules, and each game plays in an hour or less."

379,"escape the catacombs, close a portal) while the demons are focused on stopping them."
379,There are varying win conditions depending on the scenario chosen.

381,"Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience."
381,"In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner."
381,"Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something."
381,"In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile."
381,"First, players are given insider information each round."
381,This information dictates how a stock’s value will change at the end of the round.
381,"By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time."
381,"Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles."
381,These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game.
381,"In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles."
381,Not all cards are good either.
381,Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid.
381,"By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line."
381,Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock.
381,Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy?
381,"Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding?"
381,"Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?"
381,"In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution."
381,Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty?
381,Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?
382,"In Oath, one to six players guide the course of history in an ancient land."
382,Players might take the role of agents bolstering the old order or scheme to bring the kingdom to ruin.
382,"The consequences of one game will ripple through those that follow, changing what resources and actions future players may have at their disposal and even altering the game's core victory condition."
382,"If a player seizes control by courting anarchy and distrust, future players will have to contend with a land overrun by thieves and petty warlords."
382,"In a later game, a warlord might attempt to found a dynasty, creating a line of rulers that might last generations or be crushed by the rise of a terrible, arcane cult."
382,"In Oath, there are no fancy production tricks, app-assisted mechanisms or production gimmicks."
382,The game can be reset at any time and doesn't require the same play group from one game to the next.
382,A player might use the fully-featured solo mode to play several generations during the week and then use that same copy of the game for Saturday game-night with friends.
382,There are no scripted narratives or predetermined end points.
382,The history embedded in each copy of Oath will grow to be as unique as the players who helped build it.

383,"The Cheese System allows players to hoard the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds."
383,Mice and Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come – assuming they can all squeak by...

384,"One player rolls six different-colored dice, then each player selects two of those dice (possibly the same ones chosen by opponents), then places cubes equal to the number and color of the two dice on a personalized ""ship's wheel."""
384,"For example, if a player chooses the blue die that shows a 5, he places five blue cubes on the ship's wheel position five spots away from the current round."
384,(A player can never claim more cubes than the number of remaining rounds).
384,"Players rotate their ship's wheels each round, then use the cubes available to them in that round to perform various actions: activating cards selected in that round or earlier rounds, buying city quarters and collecting the goods located there, moving that player's ship around Europe to deliver those goods, acquiring gold coins, taking special actions with card previously activated, and advancing on a turn order track."

385,"Once players have completed the quests they will be able to enjoy great replay value with the available selection of monsters, heroes, and support cards, as well as the new dungeon tiles, by choosing random set-ups before the start of play."
385,"Aside from heroes such as wizards, fighters, rogues, and clerics, cards will include supplies that heroes need like weapons, spells, items, or light to reach further into the dungeon."
385,The dungeon deck is created by combining several different groups of monsters together.
385,"Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different hero types, so players have to take this into account when they choose what to buy."
386,"In Fresco, players are master painters working to restore a fresco in a Renaissance church."
386,Each round begins with players deciding what time they would like to wake up for the day.
386,"The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have."

386,"by painting portraits, and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness."

388,Dice (representing migrant workers) are used to activate buildings; each die activates a complete row or column of buildings in your colony.
388,"The buildings are activated in order (left to right / top to bottom), then the die is placed on the last activated building to block this space."
388,"It is therefore crucial where you put new buildings in your colony, and in which order you use the dice."
388,"As the game progresses, you produce resources, form shipping routes, send out conquistadors, and improve your religious power to recruit monks."
388,"When you recruit a monk, you must decide if it becomes a scholar (providing a permanent special ability), a missionary (for an immediate bonus) or a bishop (for possible end game points)."
388,The player who has accumulated the most happiness after three rounds wins.

Skull & Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads."
396,"Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card – until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses."
396,"Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up."
396,"The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own."
396,"If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play."
396,Two successful challenges wins the game.
396,Skull & Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.

398,"The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection."
398,"Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits."
398,"In the planning phase, all players simultaneously make decisions for the next year by overlaying (""patching"") their two plan cards and all of their development tiles."
398,The actions they plan on their cards and tiles in this phase will determine what actions they can perform during all of the later phases.
398,"In the pricing phase, players change the price they charge for their smartphones based on their plan."

398,"In the sale phase, players sell the phones they produced in regions where they have offices."
398,"But there is limited space in each region - and if your price is too high, cheaper rivals can block you from selling."
398,"In the profit phase, players get income for their sales."
398,"Players gain the sale prices for all of their sold smartphones, and the player who sold the most phones in each region gains a bonus for controlling the accessory market."

400,"Each adviser on the King's Council will award different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence him/her for the current turn."
400,"At the end of five years, the player who best developed his assigned territory and most pleased the King through the Council is the winner."

401,"• The castle, to receive income or new knights."
401,"• Into conflict with France, where all players combine their power and try to gain power points."
401,"In the counties, the strength of the knights is important, as you can remove the knight of another player by placing a knight of your own with higher strength in the same location."

404,"The card-play contains a focus on a deck-building mechanic similar to Dominion, each card will have multiple uses like card-driven game."
404,The players have to choose only one aspect of the card to use when it is played.
404,Each space captured by a player will add another card to the capturing player's deck.
404,"From the box description:
A war fought at the edge of two mighty empires."
404,For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America.

405,Wavelength is a social guessing game in which two teams compete to read each other's minds.
405,Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum.
405,"One of the players on your team — the Psychic — knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc)."
405,The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.
405,"For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the ""cold"" side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region."
405,"Perhaps ""salad""?"
405,"After the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum."
405,"The closer to the center of the bullseye the team guess, the more points they score!"
406,"The prosperous Kingdom of Greengully, ruled for centuries by the Forever King, has issued a decree to its citizens to colonize the vast lands beyond its borders."

407,"The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the correct decision at the opportune time, be it by establishing a new pasture for your livestock, growing grain for the production of whisky, selling your goods on the various markets, or investing in the cultivation of special places such as lochs and castles."
407,Glen More offers a unique turn mechanism.
407,Players take territory tiles from a rondel.
407,"Picking a tile has not only influence on the actions you get by the surrounding tiles in your territory, it also determines when you'll have your next turn (and how many turns you will have in the game)."
407,But having a lot of turns is not always the best strategy for a successful chieftain.
407,"Glen More is 6 in the Alea medium box series, and is rated a 4 on the alea complexity level."
408,"Each player builds their own metropolis in Quadropolis (first announced as City Mania), but they're competing with one another for the shops, parks, public services and other structures to be placed in them."
408,"The game lasts four rounds, and in each round players first lay out tiles for the appropriate round at random on a 5x5 grid."
408,"Each player has four architects numbered 1-4 and on a turn, a player places an architect next to a row or column in the grid, claims the tile that's as far in as the number of the architect placed (e.g., the fourth tile in for architect #4), places that tile in the appropriately numbered row or column on the player's 4x4 city board, then claims any resources associated with the tile (inhabitants or energy)."
408,"When a player takes a tile, a figure is placed in this now-empty space and the next player cannot place an architect in the same row or column where this tile was located."
408,"In addition, you can't place one architect on top of another, so each placement cuts off play options for you and everyone else later in the round."
408,"After all players have placed all four architects, the round ends, all remaining tiles are removed, and the tiles for the next round laid out."
408,"After four rounds, the game ends."
408,Players can move the inhabitants and energy among their tiles at any point during the game to see how to maximize their score.
408,"At game end, they then score for each of the six types of buildings depending on how well they build their city — as long as they have activated the buildings with inhabitants or energy as required:

Residential buildings score depending on their height
Shops score depending on how many customers they have
Public services score depending on the number of districts in your city that have them
Parks score depending on the number of residential buildings next to them
Harbors score based on the longest row or column of activated harbors in the city
Factories score based on the number of adjacent shops and harbors

Some buildings are worth victory points (VPs) on their own, and once players sum these values with what they've scored for each type of building in their city, whoever has the highest score wins."
409,"This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways."
409,"The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more."
409,Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.
409,There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.
409,Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).
409,"There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order)."
409,Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.
409,The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.
409,"In the basic version (designed for younger players < 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated."
409,"The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions."
409,"A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer."
409,"Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary."
409,"It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns."
409,"Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn."
409,Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty.
409,Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.
409,Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.
409,"You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice)."
409,Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).
409,The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.
409,"It's possible to bring a ""pre-fab"" army to the battle in order to save time."
409,The basic game is for two players.
409,The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.
409,"The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options."
409,"There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online."

414,"This description is spoiler free, containing nothing outside the initial rulebook for the game."
414,Details on why this is important in the description.
414,"Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning."
414,"At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes."
414,"Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of ""red stars"", otherwise known as victory points (VPs)."
414,What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players.
414,"In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules."
414,"At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end."
414,"What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it – and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: ""If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently."
414,Rip it up.
414,"Throw it in the trash."""
414,This key concept permeates through the game.
414,"Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently."
414,"These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older ""match three symbols"" style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players."
414,"The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes."
414,Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game.
414,"The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening."
414,"The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection."
414,"The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a ""major bonus,"" such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games."
414,"Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country."
414,"It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer."
414,"Nor is this a ""disposable"" game, merely a customized one."
414,"The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique."
414,"Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup."
415,"In Amerigo, the players help Amerigo Vespucci on his journey to discover new land."
415,"The players explore the islands of South America, secure trading routes, and build settlements."
415,"The actions available to players are determined through the use of a specialized cube tower, which has appeared in the Queen titles Im Zeichen des Kreuzes and Wallenstein."
415,"At the start of the game, this tower is seeded with action cubes, which come in seven colors, with each color matching a particular type of action."
415,During the game players will drop additional action cubes into the tower – but some of these cubes might get stuck in the floors of the tower while other cubes already in the tower are knocked free.
415,"Thus, players need to play both tactically – taking advantage of the actions currently available in the best way possible – and strategically – using their knowledge of which actions do what to play well over the course of the game."
415,"The game board is composed of nine, twelve or sixteen tiles, depending on the number of players."
415,"Players sail their ships through the landscape created for this game, landing on islands to plan and build settlements, which then supply resources and allow the player to earn victory points."
415,Players might want to invest in cannons to protect themselves from pirates roaming the waters or acquire progress tokens to gain special advantages.
416,Commands & Colors: Napoleonics allows you to re-fight epic battles of the Napoleonic era.
416,"In this core volume, the focus is on the French and the British, two bitter rivals in the struggle for European preeminence during the time of Napoleon."
416,"As with other games in the Commands & Colors genre, units in both armies can only move and fight when ordered."
416,"The command playing cards supply those orders, providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities."
416,You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously.
416,"How well you handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory."
417,"Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes."
417,"As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity."
417,"You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues."
417,Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them.
417,"They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures."
417,Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities — and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game.
417,"The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease."
417,"Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur."
417,"At the end of each turn, new ""infection dice"" are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations."
417,"If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region."
417,"If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose."
417,"If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!"
417,Part of the Pandemic series.
418,This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.
418,The world of BattleLore meshes history and fantasy together - putting players in command of an array of miniature troops on the battlefields of a Medieval Europe Uchronia at the outset of the Hundred Years War.
418,"Drawing on the strengths of Memoir '44, this Days of Wonder game takes the time-tested Command and Colors system to a new level and offers gamers of many backgrounds a chance to fight medieval battles with a dose of epic fantasy."
418,"In this fantastical re-imagining of the Hundred Years War, French and English armies are supplemented with Goblins and Dwarves mercenaries and even some creatures like the Giant Spider and the Earth Elemental!"

420,"Hearing the spirits of nature cry out for aid, clans of druids have arrived, determined to use their blessings to heal the land and rescue the spirits."

421,Prince John is coming to Nottingham!
421,"Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince's visit."
421,"However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham."
421,"Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods?"
421,"Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!"
421,"In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself."
421,"Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack."
421,"The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!"
421,Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant?
421,Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in?
421,Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate?

421,Sheriff of Nottingham is the first game in the Dice Tower Essentials Line from Arcane Wonders.
422,Everyone knows of the pyramids on the Nile — eternal monuments of a powerful and beautiful culture that can still take our breath away.
422,"The players (leaders of a royal Egyptian family) choose their sites, build their pyramids, and thank Amun-Re and the other gods for their bounty."
422,"In Amun-Re, each pharaoh wants to build the most pyramids."
422,"To accomplish this, they must first acquire a province where they can trade and farm."
422,"With their profits, they can buy new provinces and building-stones to erect pyramids."
422,"For all their actions players must make clever use of their power cards, and always offer appropriate sacrifices to Amun-Re."
423,"Many centuries ago, the Greek, Persian and Assyrian empires controlled vast amounts of land and riches."

423,They came on horseback.

424,Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to 'Oh Hell!
424,"', 'Wizard', 'Euchre' and 'Spades', with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round."
424,"A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid."
424,"As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one."
424,"Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card."
424,"The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round."
424,All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).
424,"Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards — and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away."
424,"In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything — except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead."
424,"An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player."
424,Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.
424,"If a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off."
424,"If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number — but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead."
424,"If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points."
424,Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.
425,Descent: Journeys in the Dark is a semi-cooperative game in which two to five players will take on the antagonistic roles of heroes and Overlord.

425,"The heroes' goal will be to cooperatively conquer the dungeon, seize its many treasures, and achieve other objectives as set by the scenario."
425,"If the heroes cooperate and achieve their goals, they will all win."
425,The Overlord's objective is simply to use all the means at his or her disposal - from deadly traps and ferocious monsters - to kill the heroes.
425,"Each hero has a certain Conquest Point value to the party and if too many Conquest Points are lost through hero death, the party loses and the Overlord wins."

427,"In City of the Ancients, players will encounter portals to the otherworld on the Plains of Targa, finding an ancient frozen city whose living inhabitants are nowhere to be found."
427,"Instead, great mechanical keepers wander the city going about their duties - until interrupted by the arrival of the players' characters!"

428,"While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own."

428,Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant.
428,Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research.
428,Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture.
428,"These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points."
428,"Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy."
428,"Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources."
428,"Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies!"

428,"Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources."
428,"The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams."
428,Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance.
428,"When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else."
428,Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.
428,"The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game."
428,The game is almost all simultaneous play.
428,"Sidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms."

433,"Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares."
433,"Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side."
433,"Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece."
433,"Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions."
433,"Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws."
433,"Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments."
433,"Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices."
433,"There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters."
433,"The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians."
433,The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe.
433,The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century.
433,"The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886."
433,"The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway."

434,The Mandala: the symbol of an ancient and sacred ritual.
434,Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.
434,"In the two-player game Mandala, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards — but you won't know which cards are valuable until well into the game!"
434,"Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields."
434,"As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their ""river"" and ""cup""."
434,"At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river."
434,The player whose cup is worth more points wins.
434,"The linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one ""field"" for each player."
434,The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.
434,"To begin, each player receives a hand of six cards."
434,"Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala."
434,"On your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields."
434,"All cards played into a mandala must follow the ""Rule of Color"": Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area."
434,"Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain."
434,"If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards."
434,A mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards.
434,"When this happens, the players ""destroy"" the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color."
434,"Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first."
434,"The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup."
434,"The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on."
434,"Once a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues."
434,The end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river.
434,"Both players then tally the value of all the cards in their cup, based on the position of the colors in their river, and whoever has the higher score wins!"
434,"Contents:

 1 linen playmat
 108 mandala cards (18 in each of 6 colours)

435,"As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination."
435,"As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike."
435,"The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators ""Schwarze Kapelle"", the Black Orchestra."
435,Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?
435,Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler.
435,"In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon."
435,"If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots)."
435,But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities.
435,"The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested)."
435,"If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose."
435,And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.
435,"On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions — at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo."
435,"This dice rolling ""Conspire"" action allows players to make bold moves when most needed."
435,"After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn."
435,"The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards."
435,These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order.
435,"New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats."
435,"During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany."
435,"To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator & fuse, etc.)."
435,"The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards."
435,"The total of number of ""Target"" symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any ""Eagles"" rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless."
435,Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.
435,"Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed."
435,"The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive."
435,"Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance."
435,"The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group."
435,No one player can guarantee success.
435,It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.
436,The Birth of America series continues with The American Revolution.
436,"In 1775: Rebellion, players take the roles of the American Continental Army and Patriots against the British Army and the Loyalists."
436,"Each side tries to control the colonies, provinces and territories."
436,"They call on the aid of Native Americans, as well as the German Hessians and French Army in order to successfully birth a revolution or quell the rebellion."
436,The four factions each use their own deck of cards to move their units into positions.
436,Battles are resolved quickly with custom dice.
436,"If you can control an entire colony, province or territory you raise a flag."
436,"When the game ends with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the side with the most flag markers is the winner."
436,"1775: Rebellion uses the same basic mechanisms as 1812: The Invasion of Canada, but to a different end result."
436,The game is quicker (being 2-4 player) and the intermingling of units at the beginning of the game allows the action to start immediately.
436,There are a few core rules that changed in order to better portray the goals of the war.
436,"The game also comes with an advanced scenario, ""The Siege of Quebec""."
436,We recommend this for players comfortable with the basic rules.

438,The game delivers a thrilling narrative driven by player choices.
438,"Players explore a world of wonder and danger, unlocking curious discoveries."
438,"The chapters of Stuffed Fables explore the many milestones of a child's life, creating a memorable tale ideal for families, as well as groups of adults who haven't forgotten their childlike sense of wonder."
438,"Stuffed Fables is the first ""AdventureBook Game"", a new product line from Plaid Hat Games in which all of the action takes place in the unique storybook — a book that acts as your rules reference, story guide, and game board, all in one!"
438,Each adventure in the game takes place over several pages of the immersive AdventureBook.
438,"The book opens flat onto the table to reveal a colorful map or other illustration central to playing the game, with choices, story, and special rules on the opposite page."
438,"On their turn, a player draws five dice from the bag."
438,The colors of the dice drawn determine the types of actions and options available to the player.
438,White dice can re-stuff stuffies injured in battle.
438,Red dice perform melee attacks while green dice perform ranged attacks.
438,Yellow dice search while blue dice are used for special actions and purple dice can be used as any color.
438,"Most dice can always find a strategic use, including moving, using items, or contributing to group tasks."
438,"Players can store dice for later, combine dice for stronger actions, or use them one-at-a-time for multiple activations."
438,"As turns go by, black dice are also drawn, and after enough appear, minions emerge or attack, and the dice bag is reset!"
438,Players can encourage each other by sharing dice or their precious stuffing.
438,"In addition to fighting minions, each page of the storybook offers numerous points of interest, charming characters to interact or trade with, as well as many unusual challenges."
438,"And each page is but one chapter that folds into a branching, overarching story with a multitude of items and a special discovery deck full of surprises."
439,"On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board."
439,"After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard."
439,Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels.
439,"Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford?"
439,Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?
439,"In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West."
439,"The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:

Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round."
439,"Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck."
439,"Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!"
439,"The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position."
439,"The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play."
439,"Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions."
439,"At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine)."
439,"You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a ""steal"" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way."
439,"You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car."
439,"Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground."
439,"You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something."
439,"If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too."
439,"At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!"
440,Mamma Raptor has escaped from her run and laid her eggs in the park.
440,A team of scientists must neutralize her and capture the baby raptors before they run wild into the forest.
440,Raptor is a card-driven board game with tactical play and some double guessing.
440,"Players use their cards to move their pawns — with the scientists on one side, Mother and baby raptors on the other — on the board."
440,"Every round, the player who played the lowest ranked card can use the corresponding action, while their opponent has movement or attack points equal to the difference between the values of the two cards."
440,"The scientists can use fire, can move by jeep on the tracks, and can even call for reinforcements, while the mamma raptor can hide in the bushes, yell to frighten the scientists, and call for her babies."
441,"Furnace is an engine-building Eurogame in which players take on the roles of 19th-century capitalists building their industrial corporations and aspiring to make as much money as they can by purchasing companies, extracting resources, and processing them in the best combinations possible."
441,"Each player starts the game with a random start-up card, the resources depicted at the top of that card, and four colored discs valued 1-4."
441,"The game is played over four rounds, and each round consists of two phases: Auction and Production."
441,"During the auction, 6-8 company cards are laid out with their basic sides face up."
441,"Players take turns placing one of their discs on one of these cards, but you cannot place a disc on a card if a disc of the same value or color is already present."
441,"Thus, you'll place discs on four cards."
441,"Once all the discs are placed, the cards are resolved from left to right."
441,"Whoever placed the highest-valued disc will claim this card, but first anyone with a lower-valued disc on this card will gain compensation, either the resources depicted multiplied by the value of their disc or a processing ability (exchange X for Y) up to as many times as the value of their disc."
441,"Once all the cards have been claimed or discarded, players enter the production phase, using their cards in the order of their choice."
441,Each company card has one action — either production or processing — on its basic side and two actions on its upgraded side.
441,"During the production phase, you can use each of your cards once to gain resources, process those resources into other resources or money, and upgrade your cards."
441,"At the end of four rounds, whoever has the most money wins."
441,"Furnace also includes capitalist cards that contain unique effects, and if you want, you can choose to deal one out to each player at the start of the game."
441,"For an additional challenge, you can require players to create a ""production chain"", with each newly acquired company card being placed somewhere in that chain and locked in position for the remainder of the game."
442,"From the box:
2001: The “American Century” had closed with a single Cold War superpower standing and a pause in conflict that some at the time dubbed “The End of History”."
442,It wasn’t.
442,"In the Middle East and South Asia, an Islamic revival was underway."
442,Resentments bred in part of US support for the regions’ anti-Soviet tyrannies soon erupted into a new struggle against the West.
442,Wealthy Saudi fanatic Usama bin Ladin issued a declaration of holy war against America in 1996 and then fired the first shots with spectacular terrorist attacks on US targets in East Africa in 1998 and the Arab Peninsula in 2000.
442,"Bin Ladin’s al-Qaeda organization plotted securely under the protection of the Taliban, a fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan born of the anti-Soviet “Bear Trap” of the 1980s."
442,"By 2001, al-Qaeda had set in motion even more devastating strikes — this time within the US Homeland — that Bin Ladin hoped would light off a global Muslim uprising."
442,"Uprising or not, the Western response to those September 11th attacks would reshape international affairs from London to Jakarta and from Moscow to Dar es Salaam."
442,Labyrinth takes 1 or 2 players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror.
442,"With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to GMT’s highly popular Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists’ use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle — guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more."
442,"From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and later Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, and Fire in the Lake, Labyrinth combines an emphasis on game play with multifaceted simulation spanning recent history and near future."
442,"In the 2-player game, one player takes the role of jihadists seeking to exploit world events and Islamic donations to spread fundamentalist rule over the Muslim world."
442,The other player as the United States must neutralize terrorist cells while encouraging Muslim democratic reform to cut off extremism at its roots.
442,"With the game’s solitaire system, a single player as the US takes on ascending levels of challenge in defeating al-Qaeda and its allies."
442,The jihadists must operate in a hostile environment — staying below the authorities’ radar while plotting terrorist attacks and building for the Muslim revolution.
442,Will Iran’s Shia mullahs help or hinder the Sunni jihadists?
442,Will the gradual spread of Islamist rule bring final victory — or will it be a sudden strike at the United States with an Islamic weapon of mass destruction?
442,The United States has the full weight of its military force and diplomacy at the ready — but it can’t be everywhere: will technological and material superiority be enough?
442,"US forces can invade and topple Islamist regimes, but how will the Muslim “street” react?"
442,"And if quagmire results, how will the US find its way out?"
442,"Labyrinth features distinct operational options for each side that capture the asymmetrical nature of the conflict, while the event cards that drive its action pose a maze of political, religious, military, and economic issues."
442,"In the parallel wars of bombs and ideas, coordinated international effort is key — but terrorist opportunities to disrupt Western unity are many."
442,"The Towers have fallen, but the global struggle has only just begun."
442,“Let’s roll!”
443,"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings."
443,The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building.
443,"Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins."
443,"Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters."
443,"At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc."
443,until each player has secretly chosen a character.
443,"Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents."
443,"The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on."
443,"On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round)."
443,"Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points."
443,"In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors."
443,"The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Glück (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion and can be recognized by its rectangular box (not square)."
443,"With Dark City, Citadels supports a maximum of eight players."
444,"King of Tokyo: Dark Edition is a collector's edition [limited edition: 100 000 copies in 12 languages] of King of Tokyo, with the fight taking place in an alternative and darker world in which the struggle for control of Tokyo has never been so fierce...and wicked!"

445,"In Deus, players work to develop their own civilizations in a shared environment."
445,"Each player starts the game with five building cards, and on a turn a player either uses one of these cards to construct a building or discard one or more cards to make an offering to a god."
445,"Cards come in six colors: red for military, green for resource production, blue for trade, brown for scoring, purple for temples, and yellow for a variety of effects."
445,"When you construct a building, you build it in the appropriate location on the modular game board — which is sized based on the number of players with the hexagonal tiles composed of seven landscape ""circles"" — then you place the card in your personal tableau in the appropriate stack of colored cards and activate the power of all of those cards already in your tableau, starting with the card at the bottom of the stack."
445,"When you make an offering, you discard cards, then receive the help of a god associated with one of the cards that you discarded, with the number of cards determining the strength of the associated action."
445,You then refill your hand to five cards.
445,The game ends either when all the barbarian villages on the game board have been surrounded and attacked or when all the temples have been constructed.
445,Whoever has the most points wins.
446,"Hanabi—named for the Japanese word for ""fireworks""—is a cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order."

446,"The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1–5 in each color."
446,"For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1–5."
446,"Sounds easy, right?"
446,"Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players."
446,"To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards."
446,Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.
446,"An extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play."
446,Hanabi was originally published as part of Hanabi & Ikebana.

447,"Each player represents a knight of the Round Table and they must collaborate to overcome a number of quests, ranging from defeating the Black Knight to the search for the Holy Grail."
447,Completed quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot.
447,The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls.
447,"On each knight's turn, the knight takes a ""heroic action"", such as moving to a new quest, building his hand, or playing cards to advance the forces of good."
447,"However, he must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat."
447,"Moreover, one of the knights may be a traitor, pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering his fellow knights in subtle ways, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment..."

448,"Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors."
448,Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino.
448,The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino.
448,"On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get."
448,The card also is one of the casino colors.

450,"In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings."

450,"Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins."

450,"At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc."
450,until each player has secretly chosen a character.
450,"Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents."

450,"On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round)."
450,"Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points."
450,"In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors."
450,"The 2016 edition of Citadels includes twenty-seven characters — eight from the original Citadels, ten from the Dark City expansion, and nine new ones — along with thirty unique building districts, and the rulebook includes six preset lists of characters and districts beyond the starter list, each crafted to encourage a different style and intensity of gameplay."

455,Betrayal Legacy marries the concept of Betrayal at House on the Hill — exploring a haunted mansion — with the permanency and multi-game storytelling exhibited by Daviau's Risk Legacy and other legacy games that followed.
455,Betrayal Legacy consists of a prologue and a thirteen-chapter story that takes place over decades.
455,"Players represent families, with specific members of a family participating in one story, then perhaps an older version of those characters (assuming they lived) or their descendants showing up in later stories."
455,"Why would people keep exploring a haunted mansion for decade after decade, especially when horrible things happen there?"
455,"Curiosity, I suppose, or perhaps an ignorant boldness that comes from the belief that we know better than those who have come before."
455,"Look at all that we've learned, marvel at the tools we have at hand!"
455,"Surely we'll all exit safely this time...
As with other Betrayal titles, the game is narratively-driven, with elements that record the history of your specific games."
455,"The tools mentioned earlier, for example, become attached to specific families."
455,"This isn't just a bucket; it's my bucket, the one my grandpappy used to feed his family's pigs when he was a boy, and while you can certainly use that bucket, I know how to wield it best from the time he spent teaching me how to slop."
455,"Yes, it's an heirloom bucket, and when kept in the family, I get a bonus for using it."
456,"(from GMT website:)
Volume IV in GMT’s COIN Series dives headlong into the momentous and complex battle for South Vietnam."
456,"A unique multi-faction treatment of the Vietnam War, Fire in the Lake will take 1 to 4 players on US heliborne sweeps of the jungle and Communist infiltration of the South, and into inter-allied conferences, Saigon politics, interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, air defense of Northern infrastructure, graduated escalation, and media war."
456,Renowned designer and modern warfare expert Mark Herman joins COIN Series creator Volko Ruhnke for a collaborative production not to be missed.
456,"Fire in the Lake features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, and A Distant Plain, with a pack of twists that take the Series to another level, including:

 Pivotal events that trump initiative (Tet Offensive, Vietnamization, Easter Offensive, and Linebacker II)
 Inter-coup campaign effects that vary by RVN leader
 Counterinsurgent guerrillas (US-led Irregulars and ARVN Rangers)
 Insurgent troops (NVA) for direct force-on-force engagements

457,"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads."
457,On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces.
457,"Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep."
457,"Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange."
457,"Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile."
457,"Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles."
457,Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to.
457,A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.
457,"A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities—think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players."
457,"If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile."
457,"Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points."
457,"When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win."
457,CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.
457,Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions.
457,It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan.
457,"In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series."
457,"It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition."
457,Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.
458,"In Junk Art, players are presented with junk from which they must create art."
458,Thus the name.
458,"Junk Art contains more than ten game modes, along with more than sixty big colorful wooden or plastic components."
458,"In one version of the game, players pile all of the wooden or plastic parts in the center of the table, then are dealt a number of cards, with each card depicting one of these parts."
458,"On a turn, a player presents their left-hand neighbor with two cards from their hand."
458,"This neighbor takes one card in hand, then takes the part shown on the other card and places it on their base or on other parts that they've already placed."
458,"If something falls, it stays on the table and the player continues to build on whatever still stands."
458,"Once players have finished playing cards, whoever has the tallest work of art wins."
459,"Three years in the making, Oceans is a stand-alone game in the award-winning Evolution series."
459,"With over 120 works of art, 40 scenarios cards, and more than 100 unique trait cards, Oceans is the most ambitious project North Star Games has ever tackled."
459,"Theme
Oceans depicts the boundaries between the known world near the ocean’s surface, and the mysteries lurking in Earth’s deepest unexplored region."
459,"Enter a vast, underwater cosmos: a mysterious interconnected world of sharp teeth, glowing eyes, and black ink, where your survival depends on your ability to adapt to the unknown."
459,The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis.
459,"Every other species in the ocean is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded Apex Predator."
459,And even bigger than Apex Predators are enormous Whales that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path.
459,This ecosystem mimics the known world near the surface.
459,"But there is more if you are willing to dive deeper...
Oceans also includes a deck of 100 unique power cards called The Deep that represents the unknown."
459,"These powerful cards break the seams of the reality you've come to accept, ranging from astonishing things found in the ocean, to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan."
459,"Gameplay
Oceans is an interactive engine builder, where players evolve their species in a continually changing ecosystem."
459,"Players must adapt their interconnected ecosystem to survive against the inevitable march of time (Aging), as well as a multitude of predators looking for food."
459,"During the first half of the game, players use traits from a deck of Surface cards to modify their species."
459,"With only 12 Surface traits, it’s easy to wade into your first game without being overwhelmed by new cards."
459,"These traits were chosen for their rich thematic interconnections, providing synergistic card play that mimics an oceanic ecosystem."
459,The Surface traits bring stability to the game environment.
459,"During the second half of the game, players can use power cards from The Deep to disrupt the stability."
459,"With over 100 unique traits in The Deep, players will slowly discover game-altering traits over the course of many games."
459,These traits were designed to evoke wonder and disbelief - to spark your imagination as you consider the fantastic synergies that are possible in Oceans.
459,"Additionally, there are 2 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate and deactivate at various points during the game."
459,"The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game."
459,"The Evolution Series
Oceans is a stand-alone game in the Evolution series, but it's a vast departure from other games in the series."
459,"The turn structure has been simplified, the game play is much more forgiving, and the web of interconnections has increased dramatically."
459,"Whereas Evolution has the feeling of a traditional back-and-forth battle game like Magic: The Gathering,  Oceans has the feel of an interactive engine builder where everything is interconnected, and where your engine must continually adapt to a changing environment."
459,"Join the Oceans Discord community for rule questions, strategy discussions, and to get involved in future playtesting."

460,Madeira is an island officially discovered early in the 15th century by Portuguese seafarers.
460,"Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape."
460,"This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries."
460,Madeira served as a “laboratory” for what would become the Portuguese Empire.
460,Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island.
460,"After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira."
460,"Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island."
460,"Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships."
460,"In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries."
460,"Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown."
460,"The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands."
460,"Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown."
460,"At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world."
460,Players must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements.
460,"Too early and you don’t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities."
460,Will you have what it takes to excel in all of these endeavors?
460,"Beware, wheat may become scarce, money is never enough, the population is hungry, and the shadow of piracy looms large…."
461,"In battle, there are no equals."
461,Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players.
461,"(Note that this set is solely for two players, but it can be combined with other sets, which all serve up to four players.)"
461,Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend.
461,"Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups."
461,Robin Hood vs. Bigfoot features the titular heroes.
461,Robin Hood and his outlaws excel at ranged attacks and robbing from their opponents.
461,"Bigfoot and his pal, the Jackalope, crash through the forest for quick attacks before disappearing like a figment of the mind."
461,Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards.
461,"However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time."
461,The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhauser for ranged attacks and area effects.
461,"The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games."
462,"In Imhotep, the players become builders in Egypt who want to emulate the first and best-known architect there, namely Imhotep."
462,"Over six rounds, they move wooden stones by boat to create five seminal monuments, and on a turn, a player chooses one of four actions: Procure new stones, load stones on a boat, bring a boat to a monument, or play an action card."
462,"While this sounds easy, naturally the other players constantly thwart your building plans by carrying out plans of their own."
462,Only those with the best timing — and the stones to back up their plans — will prove to be Egypt's best builder.
463,"In Archipelago, players are Renaissance European powers competing in the exploration of a Pacific or Caribbean archipelago."
463,"They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) – all this to complete their secret objectives."
463,They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them.
463,"But players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence."
463,Then everyone will lose!
463,"According to the author, what he's tried to create is a ""German"" economic worker-placement game, but without the two things he dislikes in them: the superficial theme and the lack of interaction."
463,Indeed this game includes a very present theme and a lot of negotiation and potential backstabbing.
463,"The game includes three sets of objectives, enabling players to choose between a short, medium and a long game."
463,Solo play is also possible with an expansion.
463,"IN FRENCH
Archipelago retrace l’ère majestueuse de la découverte des archipels à travers le globe de 1492 (découverte des Antilles par Christophe Colomb) jusqu’à 1797 (colonisation de Tahiti)."
463,"Chaque joueur incarne un explorateur et son équipe, mandatés par une nation européenne pour découvrir, coloniser et exploiter les archipels."
463,"Ces missions sont censées s’effectuer de manière diplomatique, en répondant tant aux besoins de la population locale qu’aux demandes régulières du continent."
463,Il faudra donc respecter l’archipel et ses autochtones sous peine de voir les natifs se révolter pour finir en guerre d’indépendance.
463,"Les limites entre expansionnisme et humanisme, économie et respect des valeurs locales, transmission de connaissances et industrialisation à outrance, ne sont pas toujours évidentes à trouver."
463,"L’équilibre de l’archipel dépendra donc beaucoup de la volonté que mettra chacun à faire de ces îles des colonies heureuses et productives, ou au contraire, à exploiter outrageusement les ressources et les natifs pour finir dans le chaos et la révolte."
463,"Pour compliquer les choses, parmi vous se cache peut-être un indépendantiste ou un pacifiste."
463,L’un comme l’autre tentera de faire pencher la balance respectivement vers la révolte ou vers la paix.
463,Êtes-vous prêt à endosser votre rôle et partir à la découverte d’Archipelago ?

464,"Take control of guitar-playing summoner, a pair of tag-teaming werewolves, a prodigal paladin, a genius artificer, and more!"
464,"Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master."
464,"Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share."
464,The last player standing wins!
464,BattleCON: Devastation of Indines can be played on its own or combined with BattleCON: War of Indines to create an even greater pool of characters and play variants.
464,"Included with the game:  BattleQUEST Guide

464,"Using BattleQUEST, players can play alone or cooperatively against automated enemies in an attempt to defeat the final boss and claim victory!"
465,Carnegie was inspired by the life of Andrew Carnegie who was born in Scotland in 1835.
465,Andrew Carnegie and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1848.
465,"Although he started his career as a telegraphist, his role as one of the major players in the rise of the United States’ steel industry made him one of the richest men in the world and an icon of the American dream."
465,"Andrew Carnegie was also a benefactor and philanthropist; upon his death in 1919, more than $350 million of his wealth was bequeathed to various foundations, with another $30 million going to various charities."

465,"On each turn, the active player will choose one of four actions, which the other players may follow."

466,"On top of that, every game of First Class uses two of five interchangeable decks of action cards."
466,Each deck provides new challenges for building your rail empire.
466,"One game might have you catering to the celebrities on your trains and fulfilling contracts along your route, while another game asks you to accommodate passengers and their luggage while you get swept up in a murder mystery."

466,Return to a time when rail was king and grow your empire!

467,It is up to you how you employ the talents of the people of London to this end.
467,"Will you favor the business classes, who will earn you money?"

467,You must also deal with the problem of rising poverty and how to employ the many paupers of the city.

468,Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.
468,"The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations."
468,"Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time."

473,is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.
473,The rules are simple.
473,"Each turn, players have two options:

play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card
pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card

However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game."
473,"The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value."
473,"Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors."

478,"The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors."

478,Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.

478,"The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards."
478,"On a turn, a player will draw a card from a display of six, face-up city cards (or the top of the face-down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one."
478,"If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it."
478,"The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage."
478,"Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route."
478,"Once a route is scored, the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on their next turn."
478,"When a player exhausts their supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage, the end of the game is triggered."

480,"This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim."
480,"The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen."
480,"Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else."

480,"You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas."
480,Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers.
480,"The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge—that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia."
480,Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction.
480,"If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you."
480,"You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing."
480,You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.
480,"Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control."
480,"You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory."
480,"You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society."
480,The dystopian elite covet these artifacts—especially matching pairs—and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.
480,"Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history."
480,What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?

484,Once all players have made 3 paintings the game ends.
484,The player with the most points wins!

485,Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.
485,"In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins."
485,"Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck."
485,"Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck — unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game."
485,"On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the ""fields"" in front of you."
485,"Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival."
485,This usually isn't good!
485,"Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players."
485,You can even make future promises for cards received right now!
485,After all the trading is complete — and all trades on a turn must involve the active player — then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.
485,"When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the ""beanometer"" for that particular type of bean."
485,"Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile."
485,"When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times."
485,"At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins."
485,The original German edition supports 3-5 players.
485,The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.
485,"One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean."
485,"This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza."
486,"In Roads & Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone."
486,"With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization."
486,The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods.
486,"But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind."
486,"In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else."
486,"You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker."
486,"The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board."
486,Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface.
486,"The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced."
486,"However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports."
486,"So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory."
486,"The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points."
486,Third edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.
486,"For its 20th Anniversary, Roads & Boats has an edition that contains the &cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition"
487,"After a successful bank heist, you and your fellow thieves are laying low and enjoying the good life."
487,"Most of the cash has been hidden away, and the rest has been invested in businesses throughout the city."
487,Everything is going according to plan until the police get a breakthrough in their investigation.
487,"Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways."
487,Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and start to close off the city’s exits.
487,Your only choice now is to escape the city before it is completely locked down.
487,But you need a plan — a good route that allows you to leave the city while recovering as much of the money as possible.
487,You will need to call in some favors and hire the local gangs to create diversions.
487,"Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap."
487,"Disguises may help, but they don’t fool everyone."
487,"Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing...
Will you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lockdown the city before you can escape?"
487,"In Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn."
487,The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves.
487,The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan — by force if necessary.
487,The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down.
487,"The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches."
487,It contains asymmetric roles set by missions that players may achieve during the game while avoiding the police.
487,The players' roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves.
487,"In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins."
487,The game design is influenced by great heist films.
488,"The merchant players in Port Royal, which won the Austrian Game Designers Competition under the title Händler der Karibik, are trying to earn as much as they can out of the Caribbean Sea, but if they set their goals too high, they might take home nothing for the day."
488,The 120-card deck depicts a coin on the back of each card — with players earning and paying coins throughout the game — and different items on the card fronts.
488,"On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck)."
488,"Each card shows one of the following:

 Person, who stays in a face-up row next to deck."
488,"Ship, which the player can attack immediately if he has enough swords on his people cards, after which the ship is discarded; otherwise, the ship stays in the harbor."
488,"Expedition, which remains above the harbor until a player fulfills it by discarding people who have the items required for the expedition."
488,"Tax Increase, which forces everyone with twelve or more coins to discard half their money, after which the card is discarded."
488,"If the player draws a ship with the same name as a ship already in the harbor, he's spent too much time dilly-dallying and his turn ends (after using the ship to attack, if possible), with all the cards in the harbor being discarded."
488,"Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present."
488,"Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted."
488,"After the active player takes his 1-3 cards, each other player may pay the active player one coin in order to take one card in the same way."
488,"When one player has at least twelve influence points — which are on both people and expedition cards — the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most influence points wins."
488,• Port Royal differs from Händler der Karibik in that it includes ten more cards to allow for play with up to five players and players can win without fulfilling an expedition.
489,A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions.
489,An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet.

489,Will you help them?
489,Answer the call to protect the multiverse!
489,"Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor."
489,"Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments."
489,"Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which ""play themselves"", requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns."
489,"On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck."
489,"Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn."
489,"Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card."
489,"Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP."

491,"In Ingenious, a.k.a."
491,"Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge."
491,"The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two."
491,"In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes."
491,"Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board."
491,"For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it."
491,"If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn."
491,"At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles."
491,"(Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)"
491,"When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends."
491,"Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins."
491,"Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18."
492,TZAAR is a game about making choices.
492,"Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts."
492,The three types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other.
492,The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture any more.
492,"The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: “Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?” Meaning: Will you capture an opponent’s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger?"
492,"If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board."
492,"On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game."
492,What to do?
492,Up to you to decide!
492,"TZAAR replaced TAMSK as part of project GIPF, which was felt to not quite fit in with the others due to its use of sand timers."
493,"No moderator, no elimination, ten-minute games."
493,"One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability."
493,"In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching one werewolf to win!"
493,"Because One Night Ultimate Werewolf is so fast, fun, and engaging, you'll want to play it again and again, and no two games are ever the same."
493,This game can be combined with One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak.
494,"Before Ticket to Ride, before Santa Fe Rails, before Union Pacific – yet after Acquire – there was Airlines, one of the earliest published games from designer Alan R. Moon and publisher ABACUSSPIELE."
494,"More than two decades after the publication of that game, Moon and ABACUSSPIELE present Airlines Europe, the design of which Moon began in 2007."
494,"According to the publisher, ""He wanted to preserve the feel of the original game and its successor, Union Pacific, while confronting the player with even more exciting choices."""
494,"The result of that redesign process is Airlines Europe, featuring a reduced playing time, a new point structure, a European setting, and 112 tiny detailed airplanes."
494,"At its heart, Airlines Europe is a stock game, with players earning points for the stock they hold in particular airline companies when one of the randomly determined scorings takes place."
494,"On a player's turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank."
494,"A player scores only for stock in play, but the value of an airline is determined by the value of the route licenses that airline owns  – thus, you're torn in terms of what to play when."
494,"Some changes compared to Airlines:

 map of Europe
 no flight cards 
 special Air ABACUS airline similar to the Union Pacific

495,"As an upstart demigod, you want to earn the favor of the Olympians and become a figure of legend yourself."
495,"Gather heroes and powerful artifacts, please the gods and bear their power to write your own epic tale."
495,"Let your allies achieve their destiny and enter the Elysium, home of the glorious and the brave."
495,"Once the stories are written, only one demigod will be chosen to stand at the side of Zeus."
495,"Elysium is a game of set collecting and combinations in which players recruit cards representing heroes, items, powers and gods."
495,These cards have many different powers and you can create powerful combination to earn gold (the help of the gods) and victory points (the favor of the gods).
495,"Each card belongs to one of the eight Olympians gods (a family), and shows a level (1 to 3)."
495,"During the five turns of the game, players will try to transfer their cards to the Elysium and write their own Legends, which are series of cards from the same family or from different families of the same level."
495,"The more epic the Legends, the more favor from the gods they’ll earn."
495,"But as they go to Elysium, most cards lose their power and players will therefore have to renounce some of their combinations !"
495,"A game of balance and opportunity with  simple action, but constant dilemmas and complex strategies."
496,"The players are builders in Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple, and the Pyramid)."
496,The game lasts 5 turns.
496,"In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square."
496,"On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done)."
496,"On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages."
496,"In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea)."
496,"In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that ""pawns"" are placed, since ""workers"" are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones)."
496,"When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields."
496,"The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn."
496,"If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board)."
496,"After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers."
496,"When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards."
496,Whoever has the highest total is the winner.

497,takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play.
497,"The dynamics of ""draft and pass"" are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum."
497,"As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for."
497,"Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on."
497,The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks.
497,"Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!"

498,Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order.
498,The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins.
498,"(source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)

In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor."
498,Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order.
498,The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.
498,"In general, players will first fill all of their robot's ""registers"" with facedown movement cards."
498,This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved.
498,If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest.
498,"Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card."
498,The card with the highest number moves first.
498,After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on.
498,"Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that."
498,"You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course."
498,This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!
498,Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged.
498,If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed.
498,If they take more they may be destroyed entirely.
498,"The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style."
498,The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.

499,"In the game, the young players are at school when zombies start to attack, infiltrating the entryways, then barring the way to classrooms."
499,Players move through rooms and entryways to eliminate zombies and keep the zombie reserve full.
499,"If a zombie must enter the school but none are available, then the school has been overrun and the players lose."
499,"To win the game, players need to lock each of the four entryways as apparently the custodian has abandoned the post and given up the school for lost."
499,"As players get better, they can complete missions, track their development through a trophy-sticker system reminiscent of video games, and open envelopes that contain new material for the game, upping the challenge they face while also providing them with new powers and new heroes as well."
500,"Description from the publisher:

501,Chicago Express was originally released in a limited format by Winsome Games as Wabash Cannonball and it was the first game in Winsome's Historic Railroads System.
501,"In the game the B&O, C&O, Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads drive from the East Coast across the growing eastern US to Chicago."
501,"Smaller, more aggressive railroads like the Wabash spring up to further expand America's extensive railroads."
501,The sharpest railroad executives vie for the maximum return on their investment in this business game lasting about one hour.
501,A session of Chicago Express is played over a maximum of 8 rounds.
501,"In each round, the players take turns choosing one of three available actions:
- auctioning a share of one of the railroad companies
- expanding the rail system of one of the railroad companies
- develop one of the board's hexes
Of each of those actions only a limited number is available."
501,"As soon as all available actions of two options are taken, a dividend phase is executed, where all players gain income from the railroad companies they have shares of."
501,"After this dividend phase, the number of actions is reset and a new round begins."
501,"The game ends after 8 rounds or if one of the following conditions is met:
- 3 or more companies have no more locomotives
- 3 or more companies have no more shares
- The general supply contains only 3 houses or fewer
The player with the most money wins."

504,"The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn."
504,"Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external ""wall"" section within their complex."

508,The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.
508,"Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round."

512,"However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way."
512,"Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals."
512,They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching.
512,"Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball."
512,"Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular."
512,Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past.
512,"The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!"
512,The stage is now set!

517,Players select actions by moving their mayor on a central board.

519,"Players can unleash a Zergling rush, use powerful Protoss shields to halt an enemy invasion, or even send cloaked Ghosts out to guide nuclear missiles to their target."
519,"Description
In StarCraft: The Board Game, players battle for galactic domination on a dynamic board of interconnected planets."
519,"Planetary setup is already part of the game - every player gets two planets to place, and will place their starting base on one of them."
519,"Planets are connected with direct and ""Z-Axis"" connections that are placed during setup, but can sometimes later be modified during the game, and movement is only possible within planets and through those connections (by means of purpose-built transports)."
519,"Each player controls a faction out of six, that belongs to one race out of three - Humans, Zerg, and Protoss."
519,"Each faction has a unique special victory condition, but all factions can also win through victory points that are gained by controlling special areas on some of the planets."
519,"Players build units and base upgrades with the resources they gather from the planetary areas that they control, and gain access to additional unit types through those upgrades."
519,"Each turn is subdivided into first a planning phase, then an execution phase, and finally a regrouping phase (used for cleanup)."
519,"In the planning phase, players take turns playing a number of order tokens into stacks on each planet, with orders placed later obstructing the ones that were placed before them."
519,"This allows players to set up combos of their own, but also to obstruct plans of other players."
519,"In the execution phase then, players take turns again, and when a player's turn comes up he can choose one of his order tokens on top of any stack and execute that one - if all of their orders are obstructed, they skip their action and draw an event card instead."
519,The execution phase isn't over until all players executed all of their orders.
519,"Possible orders are Build (used for building both units and buildings), Mobilize (used for moving units and attacking enemies) and Research (see below), and orders can always be Standard Orders or Special Orders, with the special orders having prerequisites but stronger effects."
519,Players can also research new technologies and thus improve their combat deck in a precursor to more recent deck building mechanisms.
519,"Each player is given a combat deck unique for their race at the start of the game, and when they research new technologies then matching cards are added to that deck."
519,"This allows the players to customize what cards they will draw; when the last card of the deck is drawn, the deck is reshuffled."
519,"Most cards remain in the combat deck once researched, though some researched technologies add effects that are always in play, while some particularly strong combat cards are discarded after one use."

529,The game board in AquaSphere has two main areas: A research station comprising six sectors in which your scientist conducts experiments and a headquarters where your engineer supervises preparation of the bots.
529,"During each of the four game rounds, you take several turns, and on each turn you either:

Use your engineer in the headquarters to program a bot; each round you can choose from three of the seven actions."

529,"Additional challenges result from the limited size of your lab, which is your personal stock; you can increase the size of your lab, which makes life easier, but this costs valuable time."
529,AquaSphere is a challenging game of strategy and tactics with different paths to victory that requires planning in advance as well as skillful use of short-term opportunities.
530,Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g.
530,detouring for treasure).
530,The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.
530,"Setting: Jamaica, 1675."
530,"After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers!"
530,"Instead, he invites all of his former ""colleagues"" to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity."
530,"Each year, in remembrance  of the ""good old days,"" Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner."
530,"Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica."
530,"At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded."
530,"This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race."
530,The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.
530,Gameplay: The game is played in rounds.
530,"Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five ""holds"" of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game."
530,"Each round, one player is designated as ""captain,"" with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on."
530,"The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the ""day"" and which to the ""night."""
530,Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them.
530,"Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to ""day"" - and one on the right (""night"")."
530,The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good.
530,"After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's."
530,"When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round."
530,"Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice."
530,"Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle."
530,"Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a ""combat"" die, but players may improve their chances by using ""gunpowder"" tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns."
530,The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.
531,The bees have discovered economics.
531,"The queens believe that if they sell honey to the bears, badgers, and woodland creatures, they will find peace and prosperity."
531,"Spring has arrived and it's time to build the hive, find nectar, make honey, and, for the first time ever, set up shop."
531,Honey Buzz is a worker bee placement game where players expand a personal beehive by drafting various honeycomb tiles that grant actions that are triggered throughout the game.
531,Each tile represents a different action.
531,"Whenever a tile is laid so that it completes a certain pattern, a ring of actions is triggered in whatever order the player chooses."
531,A tile drafted on turn one could be triggered up to three times at any point during the game.
531,It all depends on how the player places their beeples (bee+meeple) and builds their hive.
531,"After all, in the honey business, efficiency is queen."
531,"As you continually expand your hive, you'll forage for nectar and pollen, make honey, sell different varieties at the bear market, host honey tastings, and attend to the queen and her court."
531,"There's only so much nectar to go around, and finding it won't be easy."
531,Players will have to scout out the nectar field and pay attention to other players searches to try to deduce the location of the nectar they need for themselves.
532,"For an age, the tower lay in ruins."
532,"Unbeknownst to the people of the realm, a great evil stirred in its bowels."
532,"It started with strange sightings: a flock of crows flying in circles until they dropped from the sky, the lake frozen solid in the height of summer."
532,"In time, they could not deny that which they most feared."
532,The evil had not been vanquished.
532,The darkness would soon fall again.
532,The tower will rise.
532,"A ""sequel"" to the 1981 grail game, Return to Dark Tower is a game for 1-4 players who take the role of heroes."
532,"Together, they gather resources, cleanse buildings, defeat monsters, and undertake quests to build up their strength and discern what foe ultimately awaits them."
532,"When the heroes face the tower, the game shifts into its dramatic second act, where the players have one chance to defeat the enemy once and for all."
532,The game features both cooperative and competitive modes of play.
532,"The game features traditional game mechanisms, such as engine building and resource management, paired with a technological interface unlike any seen before in games, including the titular tower, which holds more than a few secrets."

534,"In Air, Land, & Sea, two players participate in a series of Battles, with the objective to control two of the three Theaters of war after both players have played all of their Battle cards, or convince your opponent to withdraw!"
534,"As Supreme Commander of your country's military forces, you must carefully deploy your forces across three possible theaters of war: Air, Land, and Sea."
534,"The order you play your Battle cards is critical, and so is how you play them."
534,All cards can either be played face-up or face-down.
534,"Playing a card face-up triggers its Tactical Ability, but the card must be played in its corresponding theater."
534,"Face-down cards are wild and can be played to any theater, but only have a strength of 2 and do not grant Tactical Abilities."
534,"At the start of each battle, you will be dealt a hand of six cards."
534,"You will not draw additional cards during the Battle, so you must formulate your strategy based on only these cards."
534,"Players take turns playing Battle cards one at a time, until all cards have been played, or one player decides to withdraw."
534,You do not have to continue a Battle to the very end.
534,"Sometimes, it may be best to withdraw in order to deny your opponent complete victory!"
534,"In Air, Land, & Sea, a strategic withdraw may lose you the battle to ultimately win the war!"
534,"Victory points are awarded at the end of each Battle based on the results, and the first player to 12 victory points wins the war!"
535,"The new moon is a symbol for a new beginning, the perfect time to start something new and to plan your future — and that is what Nova Luna (lat."
535,for new moon) is all about.
535,"In each round of this abstract tile-laying game, you have to plan your future anew, developing a new strategy to cope with what the moon wheel has to offer you."
535,"On each turn, you have to decide which new tile from the moon wheel to place in front of you."
535,Every new tile brings a new task you have to fulfill.
535,"In order to do so, you need to place tiles of the correct color adjacent to the task you want to complete, but these of course again bring you new tasks."
535,"Each time a task is solved, you may place one of your markers on it."
535,So decide wisely and be the first one to place all your markers.

536,"In Evolution, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk."
536,"Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach."
536,"With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure."
536,Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.
536,The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.
536,Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.
536,Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.
536,Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.
536,And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.
536,So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.
536,"""The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play."""
536,"- Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal)  
Evolution was covered in the journal Nature."

537,"From the publisher:
Featuring beautifully detailed painted miniatures, X-Wing is a two-player game of dramatic starfighter battles set in the Star Wars universe."
537,"You and your opponent take command of Resistance X-wings and First Order TIE fighters, then battle head-to-head for the fate of the galaxy."
537,"Secretly plot your maneuvers, fly at your enemies, take aim, and fire."
537,"It takes just minutes to learn the rules, but the nearly limitless possibilities for squad building, along with the ability to expand your fleet with other ships from the game’s expansions, ensure that you’ll find plenty of Star Wars action to explore and enjoy for years to come!"
537,"X-Wing is a two-player miniatures game of fantastic, high-speed dogfights."
537,"Now, for the first time, you can enjoy these dramatic space battles with the incredible new starfighters from The Force Awakens!"
537,"The Force Awakens Core Set is the heart of your X-Wing experience and contains everything that you and a friend need to start playing, including three painted plastic ships – one Resistance T-70 X-wing and two TIE/fo fighters."
538,Automobile is a 3-5 player game that bears a modern setting when compared to most of Wallace’s releases.
538,"Players are competing in the U.S. auto industry in the early 20th century, purchasing factories that turn out low-, medium- and high-valued vehicles, starting with the 1893 Duryea and moving through history from there."
538,Each player knows a portion of the market demand each round and must make his purchasing and manufacturing decisions based on the information.
538,"Players can fund distributors across the country, but if they don’t supply distributors with vehicles to sell, they go bankrupt, taking your investment with them."
538,"Alternatively, players can drop the prices on their cars to move their market share, or even temporarily improve sales rates at the cost of research."
538,"Special action spaces are available that give a player a one-turn special ability with the actions provided by Ford, Durant, Kettering, and others somewhat related to their actual business history."
538,"As newer models make their way onto the market, they sell at the expense of the older models."
538,"Older factories give inefficiency cubes as time passes, encouraging you to keep pace with technology."
538,"To get money, you need to build cars with your factories, but if you build more than there is demand they lose not only the money spent to make them, but gain inefficiency cubes that hurt them for the rest of the game."
538,Whoever manages their car factories the best over this 120-150 minute game will win.
539,"Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert."
539,Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.
539,"Publisher's Description
From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels!"
539,"The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy."
539,"But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare."
539,"In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert."
539,"By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power."
539,Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans.
539,There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win.
539,Should you try to build the longest caravan?
539,Or should you dominate the desert's oases?
539,"Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes."
539,Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.
540,"Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game."
540,"One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc."
540,The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material).
540,"The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision."
540,"Each game is a scenario, played on a map."
540,"There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it."
540,"The game is fast, one hour approximately."
540,"It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually."
540,There are 9 scenarios in the base box.
540,"At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes)."
540,"The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc."
540,"), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario."
540,"The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance)."
540,"Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc."
540,"During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest."
540,"If they activate, they can spend ""gems"" from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc."
540,"If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their ""spent"" pool box to their ""available"" pool box."
540,"When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action."
540,"There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong)."
540,"Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc."
540,"Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.)"
540,which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.
540,The Overlord plays differently.
540,"He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems."
540,"Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities)."
540,The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8.
540,"The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc."
540,"Whatever tile the Overlord chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8."
540,"The Overlord can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario)."
540,"In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective — but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal."
541,Score the most victory points by delivering potions via Broom Service throughout the magical realm.
541,Broom Service is a card-based game that combines luck and skill and balances timely bluffing with clever hand management.
541,"Remake of award-winning Witch's Brew:

New theme!"
541,"Now with 3 types of roles: witches, druids, and gatherers."
541,"Drizzelda, the weather fairy, helps chase away the bad weather."
541,New illustrations and game pieces.
541,"Same style of play, and by the same game designer as Witch’s Brew."
541,New version also includes a 2-player version.
541,"The game is played over 7 rounds, with 4 turns per round."
541,"Each round, players simultaneously select 4 of their 10 role cards, and then they take turns playing one role at a time."
541,"Each role has a brave action and a cowardly action; the brave action is stronger, but riskier, as another player could steal the action from you later; the cowardly action is safer, but not as robust."
541,How well can you bluff your opponents?
541,"Use the gatherer roles to collect ingredients to make potions, the witch roles to zoom around on your broom to different areas, and the witch or druid roles to deliver the potions, collecting victory points as you go."
541,"Chase away lightning clouds with the help of the weather fairy, and keep an eye on the event cards that change game play, one event per round."
541,The winner is the player with the most victory points after all 7 rounds are complete and end-of-game bonus points have been awarded.
542,Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century.
542,"Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire."
542,"Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution."
542,"From the designer:
Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century."
542,Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies.
542,"The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances."
542,"Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other."
542,"This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war."
542,This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with.
542,Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him.
542,"On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution."
542,"Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules."
543,"Developer Stefan Brück at alea describes Las Vegas as ""an easy, dice-rolling, fun-and-luck game with a lot of interaction and 'schadenfreude'""."
543,Who doesn't love schadenfreude?
543,"(Well, other than those being schadened, I suppose...)
In more detail, Las Vegas includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die."
543,"For each mat, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable."
543,"Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling."
543,"When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked ""1""."
543,You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn.
543,All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used.
543,"Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the money associated with it."
543,"In case of a tie, the next non-tied player takes the highest-valued money card at that casino."
543,Las Vegas rates a 1 out of 10 on alea's difficulty scale.
544,It's a manufacturing arms race!
544,Compete against other players as you try to build the most efficient set of factories in the shortest time.
544,"You must carefully manage your blueprints, train your workers, and manufacture as many goods as possible in order to achieve industrial dominance!"
544,"In Fantastic Factories, you race to manufacture the most goods or build the most prestigious buildings."
544,"There are elements of dice rolling, worker placement, engine building, resource management, tableau building, simultaneous play, and some card drafting."
544,"Each round is split into two phases, the market phase and the work phase."
544,"During the market phase, you choose to either acquire a new blueprint for free or pay to hire a contractor."
544,Blueprints are used to construct new factories during the work phase.
544,Contractors can be used to reinforce your strategy by providing resources or allowing you to roll additional dice.
544,You need to be mindful of what cards are available in the marketplace and the strategies your opponents may be pursuing.
544,"During the work phase, all players simultaneously roll their dice and use their dice as workers to run factories."
544,Factories start as blueprints and need to be constructed.
544,"Once constructed, each factory can be used once each turn."
544,Worker placement can happen in any order and figuring out the correct sequence can enable a powerful chain of actions.
544,"Additionally, you can build training facilities that allow you to manipulate the dice values of your workers."
544,Each work phase is like solving a unique worker placement puzzle in order to optimize your output of resources and goods.
544,"Once any player has manufactured 12 goods or constructed 10 buildings, the game end is triggered and one additional and final round is played."
544,The player with the most points wins (combination of building prestige and manufactured goods).
544,"With over 30 unique blueprints and countless synergies across buildings, each game is unique."
544,Fantastic Factories offers a lot of replay value and satisfaction as players discover new factory engines with each game.
544,"—description from the publisher
A large collection of solo puzzles have also been created for Fantastic Factories along with official tools to create more."
544,This puzzle collection can be found in the BGG Play-By-Forum area.
545,"In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards)."
545,"While bidding, though, keep an eye on your remaining cash - at the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money isn't even considered for victory."

546,"After selecting characters, your cowboys are placed on action track locations that allow you to construct buildings, houses, or roads; claim ground; earn money; or score victory points."
546,"When more than one player is on the same location, get ready, it is time for a duel!"
546,Roll the dice and see if you are the last one standing and lay claim to the goods!
546,"During the game, you can take various actions that earn you victory points for your plots, pistols (the hired help), and buildings."
546,"At the end of the game, your buildings, houses, mountains, and money contribute to your victory points, and the person with the most points wins."

547,Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series set in the stone age.
547,"As in other Carcassonne games, players take turns placing tiles to create the landscape and placing meeples to score points from the map they're creating."
547,The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
547,"Instead of cities, roads, and farms, Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers has forests, rivers, lakes, and meadows."
547,"Players' meeples can represent hunters (when placed in the meadows), gatherers (in a forest), or fishermen (on a river segment)."
547,"They also have huts, which can be placed on rivers or lakes to get fish from the entire river system."
547,"It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new rules, including:
- A player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to immediately draw and place 1 of 12 bonus (menhir) tiles."
547,"- A meadow is worth 2 points for every animal in it, except tigers, which negate certain other animals."
547,- A river segment is worth the number of tiles in the segment plus the number of fish in the lakes at each end.
547,- A fishing hut scores at the end of the game and is worth the number of fish in all the lakes connected by rivers.
547,"The Devir edition includes (the relevant part of) the Carcassonne: King & Scout expansion
In the 2020 edition 
- Some of The Scout special tiles are transformed into menhir tiles of which there are more now."
547,"- A deer scores 1 point, an aurochs 2 points and a mammoth 3 points on meadows."
547,"- Rivers score for fish in the river segments as well, not only the fish in the lakes at each end."
547,Fishing huts likewise.
547,- Players each get 3 huts instead of just 2.
548,Tobago is an adventure game in which the players use representations of treasure maps to locate unknown treasures.
548,"During the game, more and more information about the location of a treasure is revealed and its possible locations are gradually narrowed down."
548,When the location of one of the treasures is finally revealed players try to reach it as quickly as possible to secure the findings.
548,"The more clues you have provided, the more of a stake you will have in the loot."
548,Players can carefully play their clues and use bonus-action gems to influence where and when the treasure is found in order to ensure a more favourable outcome when the loot is finally 'dug up' and shared.
548,"The game features a 3 piece, double-sided, modular game board which can be rearranged to create 32 possible island arrangements."

Blood Bowl is a game of Fantasy Football."
551,"The basic game features a match between two teams drawn from a number of fantasy archetypes, playing a warped version of American Football."

551,"The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook."

551,"In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field."
551,The game comes with plastic miniatures.
551,This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.

GAME SYSTEM



 This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole."

552,The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management.
552,"Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building."
552,"Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight."
552,"For example, Padmé Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett."
552,"Each round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports."

553,"In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, the warring factions of Westeros await your command, inviting you to engage in a life-or-death struggle."
553,"In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena."
553,"Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory."

553,"Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn."
553,"Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions."
553,"The timing rules — such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses — will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs."
553,The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition.
553,"New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks."
554,Distant islands with golden treasures — who hasn't dreamed of that?!
554,"Silver & Gold combines simple rules, fast action, luck, and planning as players try to complete treasure map after treasure map, with the maps being printed on wipeable cards to allow for endless adventures..."
555,"Dice Throne is a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful heroes, and unique abilities."
555,"It's a fast-paced 2-6 player combat game (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all)."
555,Select from a variety of heroes that play and feel completely distinct from one another.
555,Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of five dice.
555,"Accumulate combat points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's)."
555,Let's take a look at a turn of a 1v1 game.
555,The game begins with 2 players selecting their heroes.
555,Player One chooses Moon Elf and player two picks Barbarian.
555,Each player begins the game with 50 HP (Health Points).
555,Player One (the Moon Elf) won the roll to go first.
555,The Moon Elf draws their 4 starting game cards and begins the game with 1 CP (Combat Point).
555,Note- The player that wins the starting roll does not draw a card (above their starting hand of 4) or gain CP above their 1 starting CP.
555,"The Moon Elf then checks for status effects (like poison, or Burn) to resolve."
555,The next phase is called Main Phase (1).
555,This is where the Moon Elf player can upgrade their hero board with cards from their hands if they have enough CP to pay for the upgrades.
555,They can also play any Main Phase Action cards (blue cards).
555,Then they enter the Offensive Roll Phase.
555,The Moon Elf can take up to 3 roll attempts (with their 5 dice) to accomplish an action or attack from their hero board.
555,After deciding on an action within the 3 roll attempts an action is declared.
555,Then the Defensive Roll Phase begins where the opponent (Barbarian) can use their defensive roll (as it appears on their hero board).
555,The amount of damage or incoming status affects are resolved and that concludes the Defensive Roll Phase.
555,During Offensive and Defensive Roll Phase any player can play Roll Phase Action cards from their hand as long as they have the CP to pay for it.
555,The Moon Elf player enters their second Main Phase where they can do any final hero board upgrades or play blue Main Phase Action cards.
555,The Moon Elf then must discard any extra cards over 6 from their hand.
555,The Barbarian player begins his turn by drawing one additional card (over his starting hand of 4) and gaining one CP (Combat Point) for a total of 2.
555,The Barbarian then follows the same phases the Moon Elf.
555,The game alternates hero turns until one player is at 0 Health.
555,"DiceThrone is for 2-6 players, ages 8+, and runs 20-30 minutes for a battle."
555,With the ever expanding gallery of heroes the game feels fresh each time you jump in!
556,"Game description from the publisher:
For a time, the humans of Sera knew peace...then Emergence Day came."
556,"The Locust horde arrived without warning, and countless horrors spilled forth from their underground burrows."
556,"The Coalition of Organized Governments (COG) struggled to fend off the subterranean threat, but their defenses were quickly crushed."
556,"With billions dead, humans turned their weapons of mass destruction on their own cities to deny the enemy control."
556,"Now the long struggle against overwhelming odds approaches one final, desperate stand."
556,"Gears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games."
556,"One to four players take on the roles of COG soldiers cooperating to destroy the Locust horde, and must work together to complete missions against an ingeniously challenging and varied game system."
556,"In Gears of War: The Board Game, you’ll relive classic moments from Gears of War and Gears of War 2 – Roadie Run into cover, spray your enemy with blind fire, or rip him in half with your Lancer's chainsaw!"
556,"In Gears of War: The Board Game you must fulfill one of seven randomly constructed missions and support your fellow COGs as your team engages an unflinching enemy in furious, white-knuckle firefights!"
556,"Only through teamwork and communication will you gain a tactical advantage, completing your mission and striking a blow for humanity."
556,You'll need every soldier you can get if you hope to send the Locust horde back to their holes.
556,Leave no man behind!
556,"ERRATA
- In the Roadblocks mission level 3, use tile 12A instead of 3A."
556,"- In the rules, under Component List, the following three entries are incorrect:
-- 23 Wound/Dropped Weapon Markers, should be 22
-- 12 Grenade Tokens, should be 14
-- 36 Ammo Tokens, should be 44"
557,"The isle of Atlantis, your home, is sinking."
557,Will you be able to save your people in time?
557,"Atlantis Rising is a co-operative worker placement game in which you must work together with up to six other players to deploy citizens across your homeland, gathering resources in order to build a cosmic gate that can save your people."
557,"Workers placed close to the shoreline are more rewarding, but are more likely to be flooded and the actions lost."
557,"Every turn, each player draws a misfortune card that will flood certain locations along the ever-shrinking Atlantis shoreline, or may otherwise work to undermine your efforts to save your people."
557,"So you must race to gather the necessary resources to build and power the gate, before the island disappears beneath the waves forever."
557,"This edition contains all new art and graphic design, created to bring even more attention to the thematic setting of the game."
557,"The Athenians Attack phase has been replaced with the Wrath of the Gods phase, requiring more strategic planning and adding to the sense of urgency."
557,"Now, instead of placing workers in an Atlantean Navy, players must cooperatively decide to flood a set number of tiles at the end of each round."
557,"To further aid them in their task, Councilor player powers have been expanded and made more impactful, and the knowledge deck has similarly been revised and expanded."
557,"The variable gate components, once built, no longer offer one-time bonuses, but create new worker placement spots where players can send Atlantean workers to unleash actions to help save their island."
558,Play as trolls rebuilding your abandoned kingdom under the mountain in In the Hall of the Mountain King.
558,"With muscle and magic, you'll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain."
558,Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system.
558,Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!
558,"Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map."
558,"You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues."
558,"Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain."
558,A major aspect of the game is the cascading production.
558,"You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources — gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers — that it produces."
558,"When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a ""pyramid""."
558,"The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry."
558,"In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears."
558,The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.
558,"The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!"
559,Zombicide is a collaborative game in which players take the role of a survivor – each with unique abilities – and harness both their skills and the power of teamwork against the hordes of unthinking undead!
559,"Zombies are predictable, stupid but deadly, controlled by simple rules and a deck of cards."
559,"Unfortunately for you, there are a LOT more zombies than you have bullets."
559,"Find weapons, kill zombies."
559,"The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get; the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear."
559,The only way out is zombicide!
559,"Play ten scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, download new scenarios from the designer's website, or create your own!"
559,This is just a great game for zombie lovers!
559,"Integrates with:

Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak
Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue"
560,From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen—a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same.
560,"This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!"
560,"Along with this new breed of game comes a new world: the Crucible, an artificial world built from the pieces of countless planets across the stars."
560,"Here, anything is possible."
560,"This world was built for the Archons, god-like beings who, for all their power, know little about their own origins."
560,"The Archons clash in constant struggles, leading motley companies of various factions as they seek to find and unlock the planet’s hidden Vaults to gain ultimate knowledge and power."
560,"This starter set contains two starter decks, two unique Archon Decks, and all the keys and tokens two players need to play!"
560,KeyForge: Call of the Archons is the world's first Unique Deck Game.
560,"Every single Archon Deck that you'll use to play is truly unique and one-of-a kind, with its own Archon and its own mixture of cards in the deck."
560,"If you pick up an Archon Deck, you know that you're the only person in existence with access to this exact deck and its distinct combination of cards."
560,"In fact, in just the first set of KeyForge: Call of the Archons, there are more than 104 quadrillion possible decks!"
560,"Every Archon Deck contains a full play experience with a deck that cannot be altered, meaning it's ready to play right out of the box."
560,"Not only does this remove the need for deckbuilding or boosters, it also creates a new form of gameplay with innovative mechanics that challenges you to use every card in your deck to find the strongest and most cunning combinations."
560,"It is not the cards themselves that are powerful, but rather the interactions between them—interactions that can only be found in your deck."
560,Your ability to make tough tactical decisions will determine your success as you and your opponent trade blows in clashes that can shift in an instant!
560,"KeyForge: Call of the Archons is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious Æmber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults."
560,"You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House."
560,"For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare ""Sanctum"" at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum."
560,Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.
560,"Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent."
560,"If you wish to weaken your rival’s forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength."
560,"Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more Æmber to your pool."
560,"Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost — choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity!"
560,Yet balance is key.
560,"If you simply reap more Æmber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren."
560,"But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of Æmber, you won't move any closer to your goal!"
560,"If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six Æmber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory."
560,The first to forge three keys wins!
560,—description from the publisher
561,"You are head of a family in an Italian city-state, a city run by a weak and corrupt court."
561,"You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power."
561,"Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile."
561,Only one family will survive...
561,"In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area."
561,"Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence – i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:

 Duke: Take three coins from the treasury."
561,Block someone from taking foreign aid.
561,Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.
561,Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.
561,"Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you."
561,"Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two."
561,Block someone from stealing coins from you.
561,"On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:

 Income: Take one coin from the treasury."
561,Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.
561,"Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence."
561,"(If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)"
561,"When you take one of the character actions – whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action – that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you."
561,"In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up."
561,"Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game."
561,"If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not."
561,"The last player to still have influence – that is, a face-down character – wins the game!"
561,"A new & optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards & Cards."
561,Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game).
561,The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.
561,Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters.
561,OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which).
561,"If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck."
561,They then shuffle the old card into the Court deck.
561,Block someone from stealing coins from you.
562,Send out the scouts!
562,Position the Flagship in tactical orbit!
562,And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new!
562,"Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars."
562,How will history remember you?
562,As a ravenous destroyer?
562,A clever tactician?
562,A dauntless explorer?
562,"Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation."
562,"In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space."
562,"Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful."
562,So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.
562,Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships.
562,These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects.
562,"You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships."
562,"Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game."
562,You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors.
562,"Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move."
562,"The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own."
562,"The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win."
562,"With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players."
562,"Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6."
563,Fleet: The Dice Game is an exciting new strategic roll and write dice game from the creators of Fleet!
563,"Fleet: The Dice Game is heavier than many roll and write games and captures the tense, meaningful decisions of Fleet."
563,Fleet: The Dice Game is for 1-4 players.
563,"In Fleet: The Dice Game, you are back in beautiful Ridback Bay to reap its rewards!"
563,"Fleet: The Dice Game takes place over 10 rounds with each round having two phases, the Boat Phase and the Town Phase."
563,"In the boat phase, the active player rolls players plus one boat dice."
563,"In turn order, each player selects one die to use immediately."
563,"By selecting a boat die, they get to check off the matching boat type on their sheet - unlocking license powers and boat launches to catch fish."
563,The die that remains after all players have selected is then used by all players.
563,"In the town phase, you roll town dice equal to players plus one boat die."
563,"Again, in turn order each player selects one die to use immediately."
563,"In the town phase, you unlock special buildings in the Wharf that grant bonuses, awesome ships in the harbor to earn points and catch more fish, or go to the market and gain income to generate bonus actions."
563,The die that remains after all players have selected is then used by all players.
563,Fishing occurs between phases in the even rounds and the player with the most points at game end wins!
563,Fleet: The Dice Game also features a fully integrated solo mode where you battle Captain Ruth to earn the most points and reap the rewards of Ridback Bay.
564,"Triumph & Tragedy is a geopolitical strategy game for 3  players (also playable by 2) covering the competition for European supremacy during the period 1936-45 between Capitalism (the West), Communism (the Soviet  Union) and Fascism (the Axis)."
564,"It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or  technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily."
564,"The 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas."
564,"Military units are 5/8"" blocks, of 7 types   (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral)."
564,The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition.
564,"There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types."
564,"The  game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe."
564,"With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out."
564,The  game may end peacefully or there may be war.
564,"There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace)."
564,"You can win peacefully by:  
• Economic Hegemony (total of Production + secret Peace Dividend values + Atomic Research is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR 
• Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages and be able to deliver it to a Main Capital)."
564,"If there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods (with extra Economic Hegemony victory points available), or by:
• Military Victory (capture TWO enemy capitals out of nine: each player controls three)."
564,Economic production underlies all forms of power in the game.
564,"Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace."
564,"Powers can spend their current economic Production on either: 
• Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR 
• Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR 
• Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels)."
564,Building a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production.
564,Simple.
564,You can’t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production.
564,"Initially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources."
564,Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition.
564,"In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control of minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them."
564,"At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces."
564,"The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: 
• Diplomatic  infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and 
• Industrial buildup (via  Investment cards), with
• Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents),
• Technology  advancement (also via Investment cards), and some
• Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails."
564,"If  the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold."
564,Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way.
564,"At  some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another."
564,"The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward."
564,The third party may well continue its economic development in peace.
564,Or not.
564,"Unit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that  determines the maximum number of units that can be moved."
564,"Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one’s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season."
564,"But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security."
564,"Combat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits."
564,"Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are  targeting (ground, naval, air, sub)."
564,Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion.
564,Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move).
564,"Triumph & Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each other), and only ONE player can win the game."
564,Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable.
564,Alliances are shifting and co-operation is undependable.
564,The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything.
564,"There is immense replayability as players can pursue dominance in Europe via land, sea or air military superiority, technological supremacy, or economic hegemony without rivals realizing their strategy until it is TOO LATE!"
564,"It is a highly interactive, tense, fast-moving game with little downtime between player turns, covering THE crucial geopolitical decade of the 20th century in 4-6 hours."
565,"The ancient Romans called the Mediterranean Sea ""mare nostrum"", which is Latin for ""our sea""."
565,Mare Nostrum is an empire-building game in which 3-5 players [or 2-6 with the 'Atlas' expansion] lead their individual ancient empires to dominion of Mare Nostrum.
565,"You grow the fame and glory of your empire by expanding your influence into new Provinces, then extending your Trade Caravans, building Markets, and founding new Cities and Temples."
565,You can recruit Heroes and create Wonders to help your cause.
565,"But beware of your ""friends"" because they may look upon your gains with envy and greed...
Mare Nostrum is a re-introduction by Academy Games and Asyncron of the original 2003 release with updated rules, counters, and map board."
565,This edition includes many new components and multiple new ways to win!
565,"In more detail, you choose an empire to lead, which begins with three Provinces."
565,"You can lead with Caesar of Rome and its powerful Legions, or with Pericles, the prominent Greek statesman and orator, with the great Babylonian lawgiver and healer King Hammurabi, or with Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, whose engineers led in the development of grain storage and irrigation, or with Hannibal, leader of the Carthaginians, whose merchants thrived on trade and commerce."
565,Now you decide how you will grow your empire.
565,"You can do this by:

Expanding your Trade and creating Wonders."
565,Concentrating on Culture and building the great Pyramids.
565,"Developing a strong and powerful Military to occupy the Provinces of other empires, or 
Exerting Political Leadership by claiming the titles of Trade Leader, Cultural Leader, and Military Leader."
566,Thebes is a game of competitive archeology.
566,"Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations."
566,"Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions)."
566,"The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues."
566,"The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles."
566,The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this.
566,There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board.
566,"Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time."
566,"Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in ""time""."
566,"So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the ""time"" to catch up."
566,"In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt."
566,"When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure."
566,"That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles."
566,This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.
566,"As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities."
566,"Re-implements:

Jenseits von Theben"
567,"In Pan Am, players compete with Pan American Airways and others to build an air-travel empire."
567,"Outbid rivals for lucrative landing rights, buy planes with longer range to reach the far corners of the world, and use insider connections to advance your interests."
567,"As you bump up against the ever-growing Pan Am, you can sell your routes to the company to earn a tidy profit, with you then using that money to invest in other growth or to purchase Pan Am stock for what's sure to be a big payout down the road."
567,Pan Am is a game of global strategy that spans four decades of industry-changing historic events.
568,Your goal in Draftosaurus is to have the dino park most likely to attract visitors.
568,"To do so, you have to draft dino meeples and place them in pens that have some placement restrictions."
568,"Each turn, one of the players roll a die and this adds a constraint to which pens any other player can add their dinosaur."
568,"Draftosaurus is a quick and light drafting game in which you don't have a hand of cards that you pass around (after selecting one), but a bunch of dino meeples in the palm of your hand."
569,In the age of exploration the players arrive at a new home far away from their homeland.
569,They try to settle the big island and each player tries to explore one part of it by placing landscape tiles.
569,Landscape tiles grant resources and those are used to erect buildings with special abilities.
569,Barriers on the island have to be removed in order to explore the island even further.
569,Players build valuable statues and supply ships get them the supplies from the old world they need to be a successful settler on Cooper Island.
569,The special thing about Cooper Island is the way the players mark their victory points.
569,They sail with ships around the island to show their progress.
569,On their way around the island they find smaller islands inshore that grant valuable benefits.
569,"After five rounds, a game of Cooper Island ends and the player who developed the best and went on furthest with their ships will win."
569,"•••
The second printing of the German and English versions of the game, along with the Spanish version of the game, include the Solo Against Cooper expansion that was originally available separately as a bonus item."
569,—description from the publisher
570,"Game description from the publisher:
The Battle of Five Armies – based on the climax of JRR Tolkien's novel The Hobbit – pits the hosts of the Elvenking, the Dwarves of Dain Ironfoot, and the Men of the Lake led by Bard the Bowman against a horde of Wolves, Goblins and Bats led by Bolg, son of Azog."
570,Will Gandalf turn the tide for the Free Peoples?
570,"Will the Eagles arrive, or Beorn come to the rescue?"
570,Or will Bilbo the Hobbit perish in a last stand on Ravenhill?
570,"The Battle of Five Armies features a game board representing the Eastern and Southern spurs of the Lonely Mountain and the valley they encircle, and a number of plastic figures representing troops, heroes and monsters."
570,"The Battle of Five Armies is a standalone game based on the rules for War of the Ring, which is from the same designers, but with the rules modified to function on a tactical level as they describe a smaller battle rather than the entire war."
570,"Ares Games plans to expand the Battles game system in the future, releasing expansions depicting other battles from the Third Age of Middle-earth narrated in The Lord of the Rings, such as the Siege of Gondor and the assault of Saruman against Rohan."
571,"The peaks of Snowdonia rise before you, encased in mist, their summits barely visible."
571,"The highest is Snowdon (Wyddfa) herself at 1,085 metres."
571,"The year is 1894, and the Snowdon Mountain Tramroad and Hotels Company Limited has been formed to build a branch line from Llanberis to the summit."
571,You can scarcely believe it's possible!
571,In Snowdonia players represent work gangs providing labour for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway.
571,"Unlike other train games you will have to excavate your way up a mountain side, as well as make and lay the track, construct viaducts and stations."
571,All this in competition with the weather of the Welsh mountains (and the game itself)!
571,You may be assisted by a train (though that's not always best) and you'll be able to collect essential materials from the Stock Yard.
571,You will obtain special work contracts that give you bonuses.
571,Can you contribute more than the other players to the magnificence of the Snowdon Mountain Railway?
572,Boldly go where no one has gone before.
572,"In Star Trek: Ascendancy — a board game of exploration, expansion and conflict between the United Federation of Planets, the Klingon Empire, and the Romulan Star Empire — you control the great civilizations of the Galaxy, striking out from your home worlds to expand your influence and grow your civilization."
572,"Will you journey for peace and exploration, or will you travel the path of conquest and exploitation?"
572,"Command starships, establish space lanes, construct starbases, and bring other systems under your banner."
572,"With more than 200 plastic miniatures and 30 star systems representing some of the Star Trek galaxy's most notable planets and locations, Star Trek: Ascendancy puts the fate of the galaxy in your hands."
572,"The great unknown lies before you; with every turn is a new adventure as your ships explore new space systems, encounter new life forms and new civilizations, make wondrous discoveries, and face challenging obstacles, all drawn from the vast fifty year history of Star Trek."
572,"Will you brave the hazards of Rura Penthe to harvest vital resources, race to develop Sherman's Planet before your rivals stake their claim, or explore the mysteries of the Mutara Nebula on an ever-growing, adaptive map of the galaxy."
572,"With an infinite combination of planets and interstellar phenomena, no two games of Star Trek: Ascendancy will ever play the same!"
573,The Republic of Rome is an abstraction of over 250 years of history.
573,It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.
573,The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.
573,"They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents."
573,To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.
573,"While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained."
573,"A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure."
573,"If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!"
573,Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on.
573,A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold.
573,A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained.
573,"Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders."
573,"Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents."
573,A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.
574,Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.
574,This is a re-release of Formula Dé with several changes from the original format.
574,"Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side."
574,"These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -

The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!"
574,"However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck."
574,"Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed."
574,"(For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)"
574,"Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears."
574,"This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead."
574,"However, speed is not the only issue!"
574,"Corners have a ""stop"" rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty."
574,This creates an effective speed limit to the corners.
574,"Of course, things do not always go as planned!"
574,"Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears."
574,"These are taken off of a car’s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension)."
574,"Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car."
574,"This requires that players manage their car’s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls."
574,"This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while."
574,"However, the fun does not end with a single race!"
574,"The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls."
574,"There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points."
574,"In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car."
574,Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.
574,This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.
574,Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!
574,"This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation."
574,"A basic change is the use of a ""Dashboard"" with movable pegs to manage your car’s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De."
574,There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.
574,"The street cars come with ""Character"" profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game."
574,"Finally, the old category of ""Fuel"" for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting."
574,"The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula Dé Mini), and a lot of ""after market"" parts."
574,There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.
574,"In many ways, this has become a multiple game system."
575,"One Night Ultimate Werewolf Daybreak is a fast game for 3-7 players in which everyone gets a hidden role, each with a special ability."
575,"(No plain ""villagers"" here!)"
575,"In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who among them is a werewolf...because all it takes is finding one werewolf to win!"
575,"Daybreak includes eleven new roles, and it can be played on its own or combined with the original One Night Ultimate Werewolf game; when combined, you can have up to ten players in a single game."
576,"As a Renaissance banker, you will finance kings or republics, sponsor voyages of discovery, join secret cabals, or unleash jihads and inquisitions."
576,Your choices determine whether Europe is elevated into the bright modern era or remains festering in dark feudalism.
576,"In Pax Renaissance, you have two actions each turn."
576,"As in other Pax games, you can acquire cards in a market, sell them out of the game, or play them into your tableau."
576,You can also stimulate the economy by running trade fairs and trading voyages for Oriental goods.
576,"A map of Europe with trade routes from Portugal to Crimea is included, and discovering new trade routes can radically alter the importance and wealth of empires, ten of which are in the game."
576,"Four victories determine the future course of Western Society: Will it be towards imperialism, trade globalization, religious totalitarianism, or enlightened art and science?"
577,"After 500 years, two factions emerge from their underground cities into a new world, an Earth reborn from nuclear disaster."
577,"12 highly detailed miniatures represent the two factions:
NORAD: military in thinking and origins."
577,Scientists and engineers add to their strength.
577,"SALEMITES: occultists working with cadavers, bringing the dead to life."
577,"Soon after emerging, these two factions meet - and it is determined that they cannot live together in peace."
577,"Earth Reborn offers nine scenarios that take you through missions of rescue, retrieval, and escort through areas of labs, mansions, towns, and more."
577,Each scenario builds upon the rules of a new chapter: the game system is built like a tutorial.
577,"There are core rules to start the game, and each chapter offers 1-3 new rules along with a scenario that uses these new rules."
577,The game also contains the innovative S.A.G.S.
577,"(Scenario Auto Generating System), where 2-4 players can make their own maps and mission objectives for near infinite replayability!"
577,"Other features include:

    A Tetris-like board construction using polyomino floor tiles."
577,An order tiles system to give commands to your miniatures.
577,"Interrupt Duels with Bluff, betting command points to interrupt an enemy character and act during another player's turn."
577,The I.P.S.
577,"(Iconographic Phrasing System) that allows almost any effect to occur with icons, totally language independent."
577,"Colored base arcs on miniatures to simplify Line of Sight, shooting, and close combat."
577,It also multiplies characters’ variations and possibilities.
577,"The Search rule, giving a visceral feeling to searching in rooms to find equipment."
577,A Mission Points track that also serves as a Morale Points track.
577,Radio Scrambling to mess with your opponents' orders.

579,Time's Up!
579,is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two).
579,"Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them."
579,"Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds."
579,"In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds."
579,"In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card."
579,"In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer."
579,"In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess."
579,"Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!"
579,Time's Up!
579,is based on the public domain game known as Celebrities.
579,Also known as Salad Bowl or Fish Bowl.
580,"Description from the publisher:
After being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a warrior, an elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping mall for all the equipment necessary for their next adventure."
580,"They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first, then find each individual’s favorite store, and then locate the exit."
580,"In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit."
580,That's the plan anyway…but can they pull it off?
580,"Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game."
580,"Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator… All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently."
580,"However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other."
580,"If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together."
580,"At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions."
580,Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time.
580,"If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!"
581,"In the 19th century, shortly after the industrial revolution, railways quickly spread over the world."
581,"Japan, importing Western culture and eager to become one of the Grand Nations, saw the birth of many private railway companies and entered the Golden Age of railways."
581,"Eventually, as a result of the actions of powerful people and capitalists, many of these smaller companies gradually merged into larger ones."
581,"In Trains, the players are such capitalists, managing private railways companies and striving to become bigger and better than the competition."
581,"The game takes place during the 19th and 20th century in the 2012 OKAZU Brand edition, whereas the 2013 AEG/Pegasus edition is set in modern times, with bullet trains, freight trains and more."
581,"You will start with a small set of cards, but by building a more effective deck throughout the game, you will be able to place stations and lay rails over the maps of Osaka, Tokyo or other locations."
581,"The trick is to purchase the cards you want to use, then use them as effectively as possible."
581,Gain enough points from your railways and you will ultimately manage the most powerful railroads in modern Japan!
581,Trains is the first title in AEG's Destination Fun series!

582,"This sequel to the Zombicide: Black Plague will bring players back into a world of deadly medieval fantasy, this time filled with infected orcs and goblins who will put survivors to the ultimate test."
582,"This green menace is not only stronger than their human counterparts, but they also tend to gather into massive hordes that ambush the survivors when they least expect it."
582,"Set in the same medieval era as Black Plague, players will take on the role of Survivors looking to defeat the shuffling, undead menace by any means possible."
582,"In Green Horde, up to six players can join the battle for survival."
582,"They’ll combine forces and work cooperatively to accomplish their goals, and against all odds, stay alive."
582,"Fans of the Zombicide series have become familiar with the Walkers, Runners, Fatties, and Abominations that shuffle around, looking for victims."
582,"But the creatures they will face are not just zombie humans, they’re zombie orcs!"
582,The Survivors will have to gear up with a wide variety of medieval equipment if they hope to outlast these fearsome foes.
582,Zombie Orcs are stronger than the classic zombie and represent a stiffer challenge to even seasoned undead-hunting veterans.
582,A new challenge for the Survivors is the Horde.
582,It represents a growing group of Orc zombies that are ready to enter the board in an unexpected location and ambush the Survivors.
582,"As zombie cards with the Horde symbol are drawn, one extra zombie miniature of the same type is set aside, collectively forming the Horde."
582,"They will be locked into place until an “Enter the Horde!” card is drawn, spawning the Horde on the board."
582,Any Survivor caught on their own near this roving menace would best beat a hasty retreat.
582,"With such menacing new foes, the Survivors are going to have their hands full dealing with the Green Horde."
582,"Luckily, they’ll have some new weapons and spells on their side to help combat the rotting masses."
582,"Things like the Lava Burst, the Norse Sword, and the Bone Kukri will all be helpful when hacking through a pack of the undead."
582,"Oh, and if they should gather together too tightly, the Survivors can always hit them with the catapult...(did we not mention the catapult?)."
582,"Zombicide: Green Horde includes ten new challenging quests, featuring some of the toughest scenarios a Survivor has ever had to face."
582,"With new terrain, like ledges and water holes, and the ever-present threat of the Green Horde making an appearance, the team will have to plan their routes carefully."
582,Sometimes avoiding trouble is better than facing it head on!
582,Zombicide: Green Horde is the next chapter in the ever-evolving world of Zombicide.
582,There’s no rest for the Survivors if they hope to battle their way to a new hope and a new beginning.
583,"In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts."
583,"Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements)."
583,"They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape."
583,"A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano."
583,"Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers."
583,"Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut."
583,"From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above."
583,The game ends when all tiles have been placed.
583,"At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins."
583,"Ties are broken by towers, then huts."
583,Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types.
583,"Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn."
583,A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules.
583,"Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements."
583,"Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would."
583,Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...
584,"Another Reiner Knizia standby, this game plays very well with varying numbers of people."
584,"The object is to accrue the most points during three rounds, which you do by spending your points to bid on sets of cards."
584,"Each turn the current player turns up one to three cards for all the players to bid on, with the highest bid taking all cards."
584,The cards denote a commodity type and quantity/value.
584,"The round ends when each player's ships are full, or the commodity card deck is exhausted."
584,"After each round, points are awarded to each player having the most of a given commodity, and to the one with the most valuable total ""cargo load""."
584,Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.
584,One of the Knizia Florentine auction games.

585,"Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection."
585,"A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row."
585,"Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again."
585,What are you trying to do with these cards?
585,Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points.
585,"Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting."
585,"Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you."
585,"Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is ±1 point, the second card is ±2 points, and so on."
585,The player with the high score wins!
585,"A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards."
585,"Nordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'."

587,"Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro."
587,"Batista’s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim."
587,"And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive."
587,"COIN Series, Volume II
Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players—both volumes share the same innovative Series: COIN (GMT) system."
587,"Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4—and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss."
587,But Cuba Libre’s situation and strategic challenges will be new.
587,"A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes …
• The Twelve:  The first wave’s escape to the Sierra Maestra—inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?"
587,"• El Che and Raúl:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?"
587,• Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?
587,• General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?
587,"• Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?"
587,• Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?
587,"• Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?"
587,• Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics—will they help or hurt?
587,• Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob’s enforcer protect its casinos?
587,"• Sinatra:  Frankie’s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?"
587,… and much more.
587,"New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:
• It’s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum."
587,"• The Syndicate’s bases are Casinos—expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them."
587,• Syndicate special activities include calling in the “muscle” of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.
587,• Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone’s hands—even the corrupt Government’s.
587,• The Government has its own terror tactic—reprisals—and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.
587,"• The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate."
587,"• Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end—the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!"
587,"Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire
Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction."
587,"For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions ."
587,Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves.
587,"The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat."
587,"More COIN Series Volumes to Come
Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series)."
587,"A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series."
587,Volume III is A Distant Plain—Insurgency in Afghanistan.
587,Volume IV is Fire in the Lake—Insurgency in Vietnam.
588,The theaters of London are abuzz.
588,"In one week, her majesty the Queen will attend their new shows and will grant her support to one of the troupes."
588,It's the chance of a lifetime for the young authors who are inflaming the populace with ever more audacious and motley plays.
588,But how do you create a masterpiece in such a short time?
588,Whoever has the answer to this thorny question will probably enter the rolls of history!
588,"In Shakespeare, players are theater managers who must recruit actors, craftsmen, jewelers and others in order to assemble everything needed for the play's performance at week's end."
588,"In more detail, the game lasts six days and on each day players recruit one new character — starting with five at the beginning of the game: four identical ones on their individual player board and one that they've drafted — and take 1-5 actions with the characters they have."
588,"Characters and their actions are:

Actors: Rehearse one or more acts in the three-act play; the more you rehearse, the more benefits you receive during the dress rehearsals on days four and six."
588,"Costume mistress: Take costume elements to enhance your actors; if they lack a complete costume, they can't participate in the dress rehearsals."
588,Set dresser: Build the set.
588,"The more elaborate the set you build, the more rewards you receive — but the set must be symmetrical!"
588,Handyman: Set them to work on whatever you need.
588,"These joes can assemble both costumes and sets, but they're not very good at it."
588,"Assistant: Increase the power of your craftsmen, i.e., the three roles described above."
588,Jeweler: Take a gold costume element or set piece to dazzle the crowd.
588,"Queen: Earn money by giving her an early peek, or gain an objective to win her favor on the final day."
588,"After players take actions, they check the individual ambience level in their theater, gaining or losing points or rehearsal time depending on the atmosphere."
588,"Dress rehearsal on the fourth and sixth days provide another chance for fully-dressed actors to perform, and those who are well-rehearsed earn points or money."
588,"On all but the final days, players must allow characters who performed to rest, with only one of those characters being able to work the next day."
588,"Thus, the more you put them to work today, the less you'll be able to do tomorrow — but those who don't plan to do as much act before other players, so that might be a good thing."
588,"In the end, players must pay their actors, with each unpaid actor blemishing your reputation and costing you points."
588,Whoever finishes with the most prestige points wins.
589,"Aquatica  is a deep, but easy to learn family engine builder about underwater kingdoms."
589,"In the game you will become one of the mighty ocean kings, struggling to bring glory to his realm."
589,"To win the game, you need to capture and buy locations, recruit new characters, and complete goals; each of these actions gives you victory points at the end of the game."
589,"To do so, you need to play cards from your hand (each with a unique set of actions) and combine them."
589,Don't think it's simple!
589,"With a good strategy during your turn, you can take up to ten actions in a row."
589,You will encounter plenty of mysterious ocean creatures and take them to your hand.
589,With their help you will explore the unknown locations and raise found resources from the ocean depths to your kingdom.
589,Mechanically this is represented with the help of three-layered player board and the unique mechanism of card-rising.
589,—description from the publisher
590,"In Mr. Jack, one of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the eight characters on the board."
590,"This player knows which character is Mr. Jack, and his goal is to flee from the district as soon as possible (or avoid being accused for eight turns)."
590,The other player represents an independent investigator (not represented on the board) who tries to guess the identity of Jack — but he can make only one accusation during the game!
590,"During each turn, the players move the characters, using their special powers and placing them either in shadow or light."
590,"At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare whether Jack is visible — that is, in light or adjacent to another character — or not (alone in the shadows)."
590,This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent.
590,"As the turns progress, the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape."
590,"Intuition, logic, and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants."

591,"Heroic Adventures features three ""escape room"" scenarios that you can play on your tabletop."
591,Unlock!
591,"is a cooperative card game inspired by escape rooms that uses a simple system which allows you to search scenes, combine objects, and solve riddles."
591,Play Unlock!
591,"to embark on great adventures, while seated at a table using only cards and a companion app that can provide clues, check codes, monitor time remaining, etc."
591,"The three scenarios are...

""Sherlock Holmes"" — The master detective faces a most bizarre affair and could use your assistance as he pursues his investigation."
591,"""In Pursuit of the White Rabbit"" — Discover Wonderland and its strange characters, helping Alice to escape in time."
591,"""Insert Coin"" — Complete the levels of a virtual adventure, and avoid ""Game Over"" to escape!"
591,Note: All three of these have been released separately in the German market in addition to the box set.
591,"Sherlock Holmes: Der scharlachrote Faden, Hinunter in den Kaninchenbau and Insert Coin"
592,The year is AD 79.
592,"Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development."
592,People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city.
592,So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later.
592,Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?
592,"The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required – along with a little luck – in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time."
592,The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius.
592,"Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings."
592,"After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in."
592,"When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano."
592,"In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible."
592,"After the second eruption, the game changes."
592,"Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city."
592,"Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started."
592,The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.
592,"•••
The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new ""Dual Vent"" variant."
593,"In 1697 the Sun King, Louis XIV, emerged from a decade of war with his Continental ambitions still unsatisfied."
593,"Meanwhile, King William III of England sat easier on his new throne than he ever had before."
593,"With the Spanish succession crisis unresolved and looming, there were no illusions that the new century would be a quiet one."
593,"But neither France nor England could have anticipated the tumult of the years to come: a Second Hundred Years' War, during which these two tenacious adversaries would compete fiercely and proudly along every axis of human achievement."
593,On battlefields from India to Canada to the Caribbean Sea their armies and fleets would clash; in the salons of Paris and the coffee-houses of London the modern world’s politics and economics would be born; and finally a revolution would rock the foundations of society – a revolution that could have ended not in blood and terror but in a triumph of democracy and liberty that might have transformed the world beyond imagining.
593,Imperial Struggle is a two-player game depicting the 18th-century rivalry between France and Britain.
593,"It begins in 1697, as the two realms wait warily for the King of Spain to name an heir, and ends in 1789, when a new order brought down the Bastille."
593,"The game is not merely about war: both France and Britain must build the foundations of colonial wealth, deal with the other nations of Europe, and compete for glory across the span of human endeavor."
593,Imperial Struggle covers almost 100 years of history and four major wars.
593,"Yet it remains a low-complexity game, playable in a short evening."
593,"It aims to honor its spiritual ancestor, Twilight Struggle, by pushing further in the direction of simple rules and playable systems, while maintaining global scope and historical sweep in the scope of a single evening."
593,"In peace turns, players build their economic interests and alliances, and take advantage of historical events represented by Event cards."
593,"They must choose their investments wisely, but also with an eye to denying these opportunities to their opponent."
593,"In war turns, each theater can bring great rewards of conquest and prestige, but territorial gains can disappear at the treaty table."
593,"At the end of the century, will the British rule an empire on which the sun never sets?"
593,"Or will France light the way for the world, as the superpower of the Sun King's dreams or the republic of Lafayette's?"
593,—description from the publisher
594,Welcome to the Tasty Minstrel universe!
594,"Put your Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to work in the Village and Guilds of Belfort to collect resources and build up the city!"
594,Elves collect wood from the forest while Dwarves collect stone from the quarry.
594,"An Elf and a Dwarf together can collect Metal from the mines, and either one can collect Gold."
594,Build buildings in the five districts of the pentagonal city and hire Gnomes to run them to gain their special abilities.
594,Belfort is a worker placement game with area majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker.
594,"Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind!"
594,"Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort!"
595,An asymmetrical Stratego-like game themed around The Lord of the Rings.
595,Each player controls a force of 9 unique characters (light vs. dark) whose identities are hidden from their opponent at the beginning of the game.
595,"Each player also starts with a hand of 9 unique cards, which are used in resolving combats as the characters move out across the board."
595,"The victory conditions of the players are also asymmetrical: the Fellowship player wins by moving Frodo into Mordor (thus destroying the One Ring), while the Evil player wins either by killing Frodo or by moving 3 Evil characters into the Shire."
595,Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation has also been the object of an extended edition (see Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation) comprising the original characters and a full set of new characters.
596,"Black Rose Wars is a competitive fantasy game of deck-building, strategy, and combat set in the hectic universe of Nova Aetas in Italy."
596,Each player is one of powerful mages of the Black Rose Order who aspires to become the new Supreme Magister in order to acquire the mighty power of the Black Rose Artifact and the Forgotten Magic.
596,"Mages must fight, fulfill Black Rose desires, and gain strength with their spells until their power reaches the containment threshold of the prison where they are exiled, finally freeing themselves."
596,"Each mage has at their disposal six schools of magic, each one with its own strategy to annihilate their opponents and increase their power."
596,"At the start of the battle, mages start with a grimoire of six cards; as mages study more spells during play, their grimoire will increase."
596,"Every spell in Black Rose Wars has two different effects, increasing a player's adaptability during a fight."
596,"Mages fight each other in a modular arena of hexagons called ""rooms""."
596,"They summon powerful creatures, cast destructive spells, or devise dark deceptions with their enchantments."
596,The game system is divided into different phases.
596,"Each turn, after choosing new spells from the six schools of magic, players plan their strategy in advance, placing cards face down."
596,"Later, they reveal the played cards to kill each other, solve missions, summon creatures, or destroy the prison rooms, one against each other and against the Black Rose (the playing system)."
596,"After being killed, mages are reborn immediately, allowing them to re-enter the fight without delay — although their death still fed energy to those mages who caused it."
596,The mage with the most power at the end of the battle will be crowned Supreme Magister of the Order by the Black Rose itself.
597,"Dixit: Journey features the same basic game play as Dixit: Each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from their hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty or otherwise doing something that in their opinion is associated with the played card."
597,Each other player then chooses one card in their own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret.
597,"These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller."
597,"If no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then they receive no points; if they received some votes but not all the votes, they score based on the number of votes received."
597,Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on their card submission also scores.
597,"After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins."
597,"Dixit: Journey differs from Dixit in a number of ways, starting with a simplified scoring board that doesn't have players moving around a track in the bottom of the game box."
597,"Instead the scoring track is on its own board, and this game board includes a summary of the rules as well as numbered places to put the cards each round to facilitate voting."
597,"The game rules  have been revised to make the game easier to learn, while keeping game play the same."
597,"Similar to:

Dixit 3: Journey – In Europe, the cards from Dixit: Journey will be packaged as an expansion and not sold as a complete game."
598,"Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death is a fast-paced, fully cooperative, dungeon-crawl board game set in the Old West, with a heavy dose of unspeakable horror!"
598,"Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl."
598,"Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world."
598,"With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome."
598,"Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!"
598,"An exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game!"
598,"As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures."
598,"This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style."
598,"In Swamps of Death, players will encounter portals to the otherworld Jargono, a humid swampland inhabited by sentient reptiles, vicious dinosaurs and a tribe of humanoids, cut off from return to their homeworld untold years after their own portal closed."
598,"So load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell's about to break loose...in the Shadows of Brimstone!"
598,Can be used together with Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients to raise the maximum players to 6.
599,"In Kingdom Builder, the players create their own kingdoms by skillfully building their settlements, aiming to earn the most gold at the end of the game."
599,"Nine different kinds of terrain are on the variable game board, including locations and castles."
599,"During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind."
599,"If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player’s existing settlements."
599,"When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on."
599,These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.
599,"By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board."
599,"Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won't play the same game twice!"
599,Kingdom Builder FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum.
600,Fort is a 2-4 player card game about building forts and following friends.
600,"In Fort, you're a kid!"
600,"And like many kids, you want to grow your circle of friends, collect pizza and toys, and build the coolest fort."
600,"By doing this cool stuff, you'll score victory points, and at the end of the game, the player with the most victory points wins!"
600,"Your cards not only let you take actions on your own turn, but also let you follow the other players' actions on their turns."
600,"Will you devote yourself to your own posse, or copy what the other kids are doing?"
600,But be careful as your carefully constructed deck might start losing cards if you don't actually use them.
600,"After all, if you don't play with your friends, why should they hang out with you anymore?"
600,—description from the publisher
601,HeroQuest is Milton Bradley's approach to a Dungeons & Dragons-style adventure game.
601,"One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander."
601,"Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests."
601,Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable.
601,Expansions were also released for this system.
601,The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.
601,This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book.
601,Additional material which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.

602,"In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a."
602,"Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible."
602,"To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player."
602,"Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number."
602,"When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row."
602,"In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value."
602,"After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends."
602,"(Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt!"
602,ends when someone tops 66.)
602,"When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!"
602,6 nimmt!
602,"works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have."
602,"One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc."
602,"(instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc."
602,number of players.
602,"This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when."
603,"Game description from the publisher:
Cuba prior to the revolution: Under turbulent circumstances, the villages of the island strive for independent wealth and influence."
603,Who can buy and sell his products and goods on the domestic market profitably or take in the most on the trading ships?
603,"Who can send the right delegate to parliament in order to influence the government legislative process, or erect distilleries, hotels and banks at the right moment to the benefit of his village?"
603,Whoever has accumulated the most victory points in Cuba by the end of the game wins.
603,"Players earn victory points by shipping merchandise from the harbor, but also by erecting and using buildings, and by abiding by the law."
604,"""The end of her regency is nigh."
604,It's time to clear the way for a new bearer of the burden.
604,She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor.
604,"Eventually, she will have to come to a decision."
604,Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor?
604,"There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA."""
604,"""LUNA"" is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor."
604,The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves.
604,"Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal."
604,The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island.
604,"The novices are placed according to the ""worker movement"" principle, i.e."
604,"they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before."
604,"Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points."
604,"You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services."
604,But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.
604,LUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player.
604,The different placement of the islands and novices at the beginning of the game creates a different feeling each time you play and opens up new strategies.
605,"Cacao is a tile-placement game that immerses players in the exotic world of the ""fruit of the Gods""."
605,"As the chief of your tribe, you must lead your people to prosperity through the cultivation and trade of cacao — and to do that, you'll need to put them to work in the best way possible."
605,"In the game, each player has an individual deck of square worker tiles, with the number of workers on each side of the tile varying from tile to tile."
605,"The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile."
605,"On a player's turn, he places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space."
605,"Her workers then get busy and deliver the results of their effort: If you placed workers next to a cacao field, you receive one or two cacao markers per worker; if they're next to a market, you can choose to sell one cacao marker per worker at the listed price; if next to a well, you receive water; if next to a temple, they stand and look good until the end of the game; and so on."
605,He then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.
605,"Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends."
605,"Players score (or lose) points based on their water supply, and each temple rewards whichever players sent the most workers to it."
605,"In the end, whoever has collected the most gold wins."
606,"On an Egyptian holiday, players are visiting the highlight of the entire journey: the stone pyramids!"
606,"But after rising through the narrow, labyrinthine corridors, they discover that they've lost the rest of the group."
606,"After wandering for hours, they end up in a mysterious grave chamber — and suddenly the stone door closes behind them."

607,Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken.
607,"Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game."

609,"Game description from the publisher:
It is 1926, and the museum's extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions."
609,"Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them."
609,"Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash."
609,Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever.
609,Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.
609,"Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror."
609,Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One.
609,"Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game."
609,"To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs."
609,A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough.
609,The investigators must then battle the Ancient One.
609,"A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours."
610,"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose."
610,"The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile."
610,All of the explorers start in the center tile – the safe room – and each player starts with a hand of five dice.
610,"Each die has five symbols:

A cursed mask – this die is set aside when rolled."
610,"A golden mask – each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room."
610,"A red torch or blue key – these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems."
610,"A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die – you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems."
610,"Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously."
610,"You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway."
610,"Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you ""discover"" magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile."
610,The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game.
610,"At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice."
610,"Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot."
610,"Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple."
610,"When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice."
610,"If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape."
610,Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together.
610,"With the ""Treasures"" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile."
610,"Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play)."
610,"With the ""Curses"" module, some tiles ""curse"" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!"
611,"In Thunderstone: Heart of Doom, you had a chance to face Doom's very heart, the eighth Thunderstone, and defeat the ancient evil – but winning that battle had unexpected consequences."
611,"It banished Doom, but also freed him to visit other worlds, so you advanced to the next world with him."
611,"Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin, which is fully compatible with all previous Thunderstone offerings, is the next stop in your adventure."
611,In Thunderstone Advance you build your party of heroes to defeat the dreaded Thunderstone Bearers in their dungeons or wilderness.

611,"Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin includes new rules, all new cards in new card frames, and a new village and dungeon board."
611,"Integrates with

612,"In Myrmes, originally shown under the name ANTerpryse, players control ant colonies and use their ants to explore the land (leaving pheromones in their wake); harvest ""crops"" like stone, earth and aphids; fight with other ants; complete requests from the Queen; birth new ants; and otherwise dominate their tiny patch of dirt, all in a quest to score points and prove that they belong at the top of the heap, er, anthill."
612,"After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength."
612,"In game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what's going on inside his colony – that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on."
612,"The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony)."
612,"The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on."
612,"Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board."
612,(Put the kids to work!)
612,"After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions."
612,"The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony."
612,"After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game."
612,"After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't."
612,Whoever has the most points after three years wins.
612,All hail our new ant overlords!

613,"Besides this, the action determines how far you may move your ship — the further and faster, the better!"
613,—description from the publisher

614,"When the Orders get too strong, King Philip will become nervous and disband all Templar orders, ending the game."
614,Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done uses a combination of rondel and mancala mechanisms.
614,"Each player has their own rondel, which they can upgrade over the course of the game, that controls their action choices during the game."
614,"Your faction gives you a special power to control your rondel, and the buildings you erect will help you form a strategy."
615,"In Fury of Dracula, a game of Gothic adventure, one player takes the role of Dracula while up to four others attempt to stop him by controlling Vampire hunters from the famous Bram Stoker novel."
615,"Dracula has returned, and is determined to control all of Europe by creating an undead empire of Vampires."
615,"Dracula uses a deck of location cards to secretly travel through Europe, leaving a trail of encounters and events for the hunters that chase him."
615,"Meanwhile, the hunters attempt to track and destroy Dracula using the limited information available to them - a task easier said than done when their prey has the power to change forms into a wolf or bat, and can even melt away into the mist when confronted."
615,"To save Europe and rid the world of Dracula's foul plague, the hunters must destroy Dracula before he earns enough victory points to win the game... will they have enough wit and bravery to defeat the dark count?"

616,But that’s only the tip of the behemoth's horn!
616,"You will also compete to acquire coveted feudums, which increase your membership status in one of six guilds."
616,But beware!
616,Feudum owners must pay homage to the king through military service or face the charge of disloyalty.
616,"Once a guild member, you will dutifully play your part in a progressive economic cycle, whereby the farmer ships goods to the merchant who equips the alchemist, who invents black powder, which arms the knight, and so on."
616,"If you run your guilds wisely, maintain control of key locations and adapt best to changing events, you will be victorious."
616,"Unless, of course, you starve, get sidetracked by sea serpents or develop an unhealthy interest in fermented grapes."
616,Long live the King!

619,"Between 230 and 221 B.C., the ambitious and extremely young king of Qin, Ying Zheng, unified China, adding all the other so-called Warring States (ZhanGuo) to his empire."
619,"Through this, Ying Zheng became the first emperor in Chinese history, taking the title of Qin Shi Huang Di."
619,"Plenty of things had to change in order to make the Chinese empire whole, and Qin Shi Huang Di didn't waste any time."
619,"He divided the empire into prefectures, personally appointing central and local functionaries; afterward, he decreed that the same writing symbols had to be used throughout the entire nation."
619,"Furthermore, he unified the laws and the units of measure, particularly the currency, creating amazing conditions for the economic development and growth of the empire."
619,Internal decisions were not the only things that shaped this new unified nation.
619,"From the North, the menace of the Hsiungnu barbarians kept shaking the empire, and Qin Shi Huang Di knew that the only way to stop that menace was to build one of the most ambitious buildings in human history: The Great Wall of China."
619,"Thousands of peasants left their fields to take part in the construction, not only of the Great Wall, but also of roads, channels, palaces, and majestic buildings."
619,"In ZhanGuo, you are the emperor's emissaries, and you have been assigned the challenging task of contributing to the process of unifying the empire, helping to build the wall, and all infrastructures needed."
619,"During the five rounds of the game, you must make the best of the few cards you get each round."
619,"You can play each card either on your own player board to increase your personal power in the empire, or on the game board to recruit manpower, construct buildings wanted by the emperor, call reinforcements from Qin, and move the armies from kingdom to kingdom."
619,Each player has to choose the best time and best way to play his cards in order to earn the emperor’s favors.
619,"Careful, though, because trying to get too much power, or exploiting the workers for personal gain could increase dissatisfaction among the populace, and consequently increase the risk of uprisings in the newly added kingdoms."
619,"Whoever is able to make the greatest contribution to the emperor's cause, while at the same time keeping the citizens placid, will be the winner."
620,"In Yamatai, 2-4 players compete to build palaces, torii, and their own buildings in the land of Yamatai."
620,"The game includes ten numbered action tiles, each showing one or more colored ships and with most showing a special action."
620,"You shuffle these tiles, place them in a row, then reveal one more than the number of players."
620,"On a turn, each player chooses a tile, collects the depicted ships from the reserve, optionally buys or sells one ship, then places the ships on the board."
620,"The land has five entryways, and you must start from these points or place adjacent to ships already on the board."
620,"You can't branch the ships being placed, and if you place your first ship adjacent to another, then that first ship must be the same color as the adjacent one; otherwise you can place ships without regard to color."
620,"After placing ships, you can either claim colored resources from land that you've touched with new ships this turn or build on one vacant space."

620,"If you build a personal building that's connected to others you own, you receive money equal to the number of buildings."

620,"After all players go, you shuffle the action tiles, place them face down in the row, then reveal enough tiles at the front of the line to set up for the next turn, with the turn order being determined by the numbers on the tiles that players chose the previous turn."
620,"Once you trigger one of the game-ending conditions — e.g., no ships of one color or no more specialists — you finish the round, then count points for buildings built, specialists hired, and money on hand."

621,Now you need to save humanity through space colonization...
621,"Welcome to the Moon uses the same flip-and-write game mechanisms as the earlier title Welcome To..., but now you can play in a campaign across eight adventure sheets."
621,"On a turn, you flip cards from three stacks to create three different combinations of a starship number and a corresponding action, then all players choose one of these three combinations."
621,"You use the number to fill a space in a zone on your adventure sheet in numerical order, and everyone is racing to be the first to complete common missions."
621,"The eight adventure sheets feature very different mechanisms from the classic Welcome To... concept, and when you play in campaign mode, you'll make choices that change the next adventure, which means that each campaign will differ from the previous one."
622,"In Tokaido, each player is a traveler crossing the ""East sea road"", one of the most magnificent roads of Japan."
622,"While traveling, you will meet people, taste fine meals, collect beautiful items, discover great panoramas, and visit temples and wild places but at the end of the day, when everyone has arrived at the end of the road you'll have to be the most initiated traveler – which means that you'll have to be the one who discovered the most interesting and varied things."
622,"The potential action spaces in Tokaido are laid out on a linear track, with players advancing down this track to take actions."
622,"The player who is currently last on the track takes a turn by advancing forward on the track to their desired action and taking that action, so players must choose whether to advance slowly in order to get more turns, or to travel more rapidly to beat other players to their desired action spaces."
622,"The action spaces allow a variety of actions that will score in different, but roughly equal, ways."
622,"Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points."
622,Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.
622,"Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types."
622,"All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play."

625,Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares.
625,"Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank."
625,"To run the factories, you need workers."
625,"When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created."
625,But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1).
625,To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.
625,You fix the price for your goods during an action round.
625,"To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion."
625,"The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower."
625,"Each player has an own set of ""action tokens"" like ""build and modernize factories"", ""employ new workers"", ""improve quality"" etc."
625,"On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the ""Administration board"" and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (even numbers)."
625,"Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e."
625,"you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round)."
625,"During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e."
625,"allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...)."
625,"After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products."
625,The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.
625,Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.
625,After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends.
625,Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token.
625,After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins.
625,Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.
625,Arkwright allows you to act in different ways.
625,"Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market."
625,In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy.
625,Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out.
625,"Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later."
625,"To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version ""Spinning Jenny"", but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute ""Waterframe""-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships."
626,Solitaire study of America's most bloody and heroic day in WWII.
626,The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead.
626,The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day.
626,"Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks."
626,"The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their ""Widerstandsnest"" resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs."
626,"Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI."
626,"One map, two counter sheets, 55 cards."
626,"Additional Notes:


=====
352 counters."
626,Basic unit size is the US infantry company.
626,German units consist of Widerstandsnest crews and reinforcement infantry companies.
626,"US tanks, and some US artillery, AA and anti-tank units are also included."
626,"US engineers are represented abstractly, clearing beach obstacles early in the game and opening traffic routes off the beach later in the game."
626,"The 34"" x 22"" map depicts the entire Omaha invasion area 9km long, going inland 4km, at 250 meters per hex."
626,"Hexes are oversized (almost 1"") so that symbology facilitating German placement, fire and actions can be seen without having to pick up units."
626,"Time scale is 15 minutes per turn from 0600 hours to 1000 hours, shifting to 1/2 hour turns from 1000 to 1800 hours."
626,"A deck of 55 cards performs triple duty -- determining results of US amphibious landings, determining an event each turn, and determining which German units fire or perform other actions each turn."
626,"The game's solitaire system is based on that used previously in Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942."

629,"And in the northern barony of Forthyn, the stage is set for the next great confrontation between Terrinoth and the forces of darkness...

629,"Core gameplay mechanisms such as combat, fatigue, skills, items, and more have received completely new interpretations with Legends of the Dark, while a new approach to scenario layout and 3D terrain creates striking multi-level scenarios."
629,Gameplay is fast and intuitive.
629,You take three actions each turn: one maneuver action and two additional actions of your choice.
629,"Maneuvering gives you movement points, as shown in the upper right corner of the character sheet, and since you always have a maneuver action, you can reposition to put yourself in a more advantageous position for attack."
629,"Other than maneuvering, you can use an action to attack an enemy, rolling your attack dice and drawing upon your hero's abilities and weapons to deal maximum damage or inflict harmful conditions on your foes, or you may use the explore action to interact with a piece of 3D terrain or a token by using the app."
629,"You can also use your action to perform one of the most crucial actions in Legends of the Dark: the ready action, which lets you flip your hero sheet or one of your cards to its opposite side, unlocking new abilities!"
629,Your hero sheet isn't the only thing you can ready.
629,Every hero also has an attack card and skill cards!
629,"Each hero starts the game with two weapon cards, which are sleeved together back-to-back to create a single attack card."
629,"Skill cards can also be readied, switching between two complementary abilities."
629,"The app also brings new changes to gameplay, introducing enemies with adaptable strategies, complex status effects, and triggers fully managed by the app, and the ability to develop your heroes based on the choices you make in scenarios."
629,"You'll also uncover a wealth of activity between scenarios, such as crafting, shopping in the city, upgrading equipment, and more."

""For once, Zeus, Greek god of thunder and sky, is in high spirits."
631,"Hence, he decides to offer a generous gift to a worthy mortal and invite him, or her, to his realm, to Olympus."
631,"To determine a sufficient candidate, Zeus hosts a competition for his entertainment."
631,"Twelve legendary tasks are imposed upon the fearless participants: to erect graceful statues, to raise awe-inspiring sanctuaries, to offer capacious offerings, and to slay the most fearsome monsters."
631,The first participant to master all the posed assignments wins the favor of the father of the gods himself.
631,"Indubitably, you will not pass up this golden opportunity, so you clear your ship and rally your crew to follow on the trails of legendary Odysseus through the dangerous waters of the Aegean."
631,But how could you find the righteous path onward?
631,There is but one who can help you.
631,Visit the mysterious oracle of Delphi and let her answers guide your ways.
631,"In Stefan Feld's new game The Oracle of Delphi, the player's ships travel across a large variable game board of hexagonal tiles showing islands and the surrounding waters."
631,"Each player aims to reach certain islands to perform the twelve tasks given by Zeus: e.g., to collect offerings of different colors and to deliver them to corresponding temples, or to slay monsters of a specific type (and color), all of which can be discovered on the islands."
631,"In order to execute these color-dependent actions, you are given three colored dice each turn, the so-called ""oracle dice""."
631,"Rolling the dice (at the start of the turn) is equivalent to consulting the oracle, whereas the results represent her answers."
631,"The answers determine which actions you will be able to take, but you will always have three actions per turn."
631,"However, a slight divergence from your fate is often possible."
631,"In addition to the oracle, you can request support from the gods and you can acquire favor tokens, companions, and other special abilities that will help you win the race against other competitors."
631,Differently equipped ships and the variable set-up of the game board will offer new challenging and interesting strategic and tactical decisions with every new game of The Oracle of Delphi that you play.
632,Steampunk Rally is a strategy game that incorporates steampunk as more than just a bit of chrome.
632,"Using a unique dice-placement mechanism, players take on the roles of famous inventors from the turn of the last century like Nikola Tesla and Marie Curie, constructing fantastical contraptions that make use of steam, heat and electricity in an attempt to win a no-holds-barred race through the Swiss alps."
632,Each round starts with a card draft in which players carefully select machine parts to add to their invention and one-shot boost cards to aid them or hinder opponents.
632,"Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted."
632,"Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts."
632,"Driving through terrain causes damage, and if a player's damage gauge ends up in the red at the end of the turn, they must lose parts from their invention."
632,"These will need to be replaced in the draft phase, constantly forcing players to discover new synergies."
633,"In Villainous: Wicked to the Core, each player takes control of one of three Disney characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie, specifically the Evil Queen from Snow White, Hades from Hercules, and Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog."

633,"On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards."
633,"Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions."
633,You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.
633,"One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations."
633,"The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain."

637,Shards of Infinity combines an unprecedented level of strategy and customization into one small box.
637,"Rather than competing for points, players must outlast their opponents and reduce their health to zero, which can be done in a number of ways."

637,Every character starts with fifty health and zero mastery.
637,"On each turn, you can spend one gem (a.k.a., money) to gain a mastery point."
637,"The more mastery you have, the more powerful your cards become."

638,"From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play."
638,"On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, using the power on that card to expose others and (possibly) knock them out of the round."
638,"If you use Batman's ability to KO someone (other than Robin), you score one point, with points being tracked via Batsignal tokens."
638,"If you're the final player active in the round or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point."

640,"By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent’s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings."
640,"The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures."
640,"Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it."
640,"When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc."
640,"After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings – or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards."
640,Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes.
640,"In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc."
640,"In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd."
640,"You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings."
640,"After all, people want to see a dragon!"
640,"Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction."
640,(The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.)
640,"The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score."
640,"The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits."
641,"Historically, Albrecht von Wallenstein, duke of Friedland and Mecklenburg, was one of the most important mercenary commanders of the Imperial army during the Thirty Years' War (1618-48)."
641,"His overweening ambition was to head a large central European empire, which got him dismissed in 1630."
641,"Such was his power, however, that the empire was forced to reinstate him when Sweden came into the fray."
641,"He recovered Bohemia, but was defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at Lützen, and was again dismissed."
641,"His subsequent intrigues with Protestant forces alarmed the Catholic princes who were probably complicit in his assassination in 1634 by Irish mercenaries at Eger, Bohemia."
641,"The game begins with the start of the war, each player controlling several countries."
641,"Player actions include the conquest of new countries, tax collection, erection of buildings (i.e."
641,"development of the economy), feeding the populace, victualing the army, etc."

644,"Furthermore, during the game players can earn more yōkai cards for their deck, thereby increasing their playing options and achieving a higher score."
644,Each player also has three yōkai guardians (in the form of dice) that they can send to the large regions of the forest on the main board in order to obtain all kinds of new options that they can play during the game.
644,"These options can be structures they build in certain areas of the forest, soul crystals that generate resources when certain actions are carried out, and many others as well."
644,"The players also have the chance to help the mitamas, lost souls in search of redemption by using the chinkon fireflies."
644,"There is truly a wide range of actions to carry out, and this is without taking into account the personal domain where the players can lay out another layer of additional strategy while managing the pilgrims."
644,Pilgrims are followers of the player who embark upon journeys of contemplation and reflection who then share the experiences and learning they can along the spirit path with the Bitoku.

645,"Ascension: Deckbuilding Game — originally released as Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer — is a fast-paced deck-building game designed by Magic: The Gathering Pro Tour champions Justin Gary, Rob Dougherty, and Brian Kibler, with artwork by Eric Sabee."
645,Ascension is a deck-building game in which players spend Runes to acquire more powerful cards for their deck.
645,It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly.
645,"Each player starts with a small deck of cards, and uses those cards to acquire more and better cards for their deck, with the goal of earning the most Honor Points by gaining cards and defeating monsters."
646,Players compete to build the most famous hotel/casino.
646,"Room tiles representing slot machines, lounges, restaurants, and other casino-related places appear on a central board and the players hold auctions to win the rights to have those rooms in their building, garnering them income, population, or fame."
646,"Bidding wars escalate, values fluctuate, and designers renovate until finally the hotel/casinos are put to the test to determine whose garners the most fame."
647,"In The Networks, you and your opponents are new television networks, and you need new programming."
647,"For this, you’ll need Shows, Stars, and Ads."
647,Shows need Stars and Ads.
647,"Stars give you bonus viewers (points), and Ads give you extra money."
647,"You’ll need everything you can get; you'll have a small amount of resources and time, and you must grab the latest hot show before your opponents."
647,And some Stars will give their best effort only if you put them on in the proper conditions.
647,"For example, some Stars only want to be put on dramas."
647,Other Stars want to be the only Star on the show.
647,And your Ads will give you the most money only if you put them on in the correct time slot.
647,"Finally, Shows age and viewers lose interest, so you have to keep your line-up fresh by canceling shows and sending them into reruns."
647,"Fortunately, you can get viewers from your reruns, and you'll get bonuses if you get a lot of shows of the same genre throughout the game."
647,"If you need a special push, Network Cards can give you special powers — but will a Network Card be better than another action?"
647,You'll have to make that call.
647,The player with the most viewers after five seasons wins!
648,Long John Silver's crew has committed mutiny and has him cornered and tied up!
648,"Round after round, they question him about the location of his treasure and explore the island following his directions — or perhaps his misdirections?"
648,Who knows...
648,"The old sea dog is surely planning an escape, after all, after which he will definitely try to get his treasure back."
648,"Treasure Island is a game of bluffing and adventure in which one player embodies Long John, trying to mislead the others in their search for his treasure."
648,"The hunt reaches its climax with Long John's escape, when he will make a final run to get the booty for himself!"
649,Dragon Castle is a game freely inspired by Mahjong Solitaire.
649,"During your turn, you take a pair of identical tiles from the central ""castle"" (known as the Dragon Castle) and place them on your own realm board to build your own castle."
649,"From time to time, you may sacrifice these tiles to acquire shrines in their place."
649,"Every time you create a set of tiles of the same kind, you ""consolidate"" them, i.e."
649,flip them face down to score points.
649,"When you consolidate a set, you may also build shrines on top of the consolidated tiles: Shrines allow you to score more points, but they also limit your building options."
649,You may also take advantage of the available spirit card and its game-changing powers...but this will come at a cost!
649,"Finally, don't forget to check the dragon card in play, and to follow the building requirements to score bonus points."
649,"When the Dragon Castle has been reduced to only one floor, the end of the game is triggered."
649,"After one final round, the player with the most points is the lord of the new Dragon Castle…and the winner of the game!"

651,"In the U.S. wild west, the eternal battle between the law and the outlaws keeps heating up."

651,Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you?
651,BANG!
651,The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang!
651,card game in place.
651,"At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades."
651,"The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game."
651,Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game.
651,The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game.
651,"On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table."
651,"Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table."
651,"If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens."
651,Who'll get his shot off first?
651,Play continues until one team meets its winning condition – and death won't necessarily keep you from winning as long as your teammates pull through!
652,"You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out – or you will remain trapped forever!"
652,"You may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room."
652,"In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth."
652,Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game.
652,"You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards."
652,In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares.
652,Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...
652,"Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:

""The Towers"" introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition."
652,"""Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions"" adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies."
652,"In ""The Book of Steps Lost and Found"", you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task."
652,"In addition to these three variants from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box."
652,"Just like previously, each module consists of something that makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:

""The Glyphs"" introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols."
652,"Player must then find one extra door of each color (so 12 doors in total) to win


""The Dreamcatchers"" are four cards that ""guard"" the Limbo piles."
652,"The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and his cards shuffled back."
652,"Also, four new ""Lost Dreams"" cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss."
652,"""The Crossroads and Dead Ends"" introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color ""joker""."
652,"It also contains 10 ""Dead End"" cards, that remain in players hand (un-discard-able on its own) and block her 5-cards hand limit... until a player discards the whole hand (=the only way to discard a Dead End)."
652,"""The Door To The Oniverse"" brings several one-time abilities cards as ""inhabitants of the Oniverse""... and one extra colorless door to find."
652,"Apart from all those, there are a few special rules to use the dark meeple in the game (which interferes with Nightmare cards resolving), making the game easier or harder, depending on the chosen variant."
653,"Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy."
653,It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.
653,Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.
653,"In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib."
653,One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.
653,"The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences."
653,Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.
653,This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.
653,"Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board."
653,The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.
653,Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.
653,The winner is the first to reach 121 points.
653,The origin date listed for this game is approximate.
654,"エセ芸術家ニューヨークへ行く – which is pronounced as ""Ese Geijutsuka New York e Iku"" and can be translated as Fake Artist Goes to New York – is a party game for 5-10 players."
654,"Players take turns being the Question Master, whose role is to set a category, write a word within that category on dry erase cards, and hand those out to other players as artists."
654,"At the same time, one player will have only an ""X"" written on his card: they are the fake artist!"
654,"Players will then go around the table twice, drawing one contiguous stroke each on a paper to draw the word established by the Question Master, then guess who the fake artist is."
654,"If the fake artist is not caught, both the fake artist and the Question Master earn points; if the fake artist is caught and cannot guess what the word is, the artists earn points."
655,"The players in the game take on the roles of Churchill, Roosevelt, or Stalin as they maneuver against each other over the course of 10 Conferences that determine who will lead the Allied forces, where those forces will be deployed, and how the Axis will be defeated."
655,The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.
655,"Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition."
655,While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally.
655,Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace.
655,Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference.
655,"The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb)."
655,"Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues."
655,The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'.
655,"Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand."
655,A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played.
655,Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table.
655,Each card is a historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue.
655,Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own.
655,"At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card."
655,Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty.
655,Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman.
655,"Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference."
655,The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).
655,The game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control.
655,"These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives."
655,Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies.
655,"Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated."
655,"A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies."
655,"Once this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score."
655,"There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East."
655,"Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan."
655,"Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts."
655,"A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible."
655,Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day).
655,"When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game."
655,In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets.
655,If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.
655,"As I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics."
655,"The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario."
655,"All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play."
655,In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire.
655,I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month.

657,"The theme is development of the city within the ""castle walls"", which might be more appropriately called the city walls, but Carcassonne: The City was apparently already in development."
657,"It is not an expansion, but a stand-alone tile-placement game with the Carcassonne mechanics adapted specially for two players."
657,"The goal is to lead the race around the castle wall, which is also the scoring track for the game."
657,There are bonus items on the wall for the first player to reach that point.
657,"Play is very similar to Carcassonne but all the tiles must be played within the walls, which often constrains the choices."
657,"The followers used for scoring are heralds (on paths), knights (on towers), squires (on houses) and merchants (on courtyards which are more valuable if they have a market)."
657,"And, the player with the largest ""keep"" (largest house completed during the game) scores points for the largest contiguous undeveloped area (unplayed tile spaces) at the end of the game."
657,"The bonus tiles collected from the walls add twists to the scoring, such as doubling one of a particular scoring structure or scoring one uncompleted structure."
658,"Centuries ago, the lucrative spice trade compelled the prosperous nations of the world to explore alternate routes to the sources of these precious goods."

666,"Projects of such significance require the expertise of more than one person, so for each assignment you are paired with a partner with whom to discuss and execute your grandiose plans."
666,Will your planning and collaborative skills be enough to design the most impressive city in the world?
666,"Between Two Cities is a partnership-driven tile-drafting game in which each tile represents part of a city: factory, shop, park, landmarks, etc."
666,"You work with the player on your left to design the heart of one city, and with the player on your right to design the heart of another city."
666,"On each turn you select two tiles from hand, reveal them, then work with your partners separately to place one of those tiles into each of your two cities before passing the remaining hand of tiles around the table."
666,"At the end of the game, each city is scored for its livability."
666,Your final score is the lower of the livability scores of the two cities you helped design.
666,"To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion between two cities."
666,The player with the highest final score wins the game.
666,"The game features play for 3-7 players in 20-25 minutes, a 2-player variant for head-to-head competition as well as a solo variant (Automa)."
667,"After the great Chicago Fire of 1871, the brave men and women of Chicago sought to rebuild their once-great city, and rebuild it they did."
667,"Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World's Fair in 1933."
667,"Many of the household brands we've come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift & Co, Armour & Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger."
667,In City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage.
667,"In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest."
667,"Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games."
667,Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours.
667,"Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade."
667,"At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends."
667,"Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident."

668,A cooperative game where the players attempt to clean out an infestation of hostile aliens from a derelict spaceship.
668,"Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, players take on the roles of Space Marines pitted against hordes of Genestealers."
668,"Players choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities."
668,Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams.
668,"After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers."
668,Game play is quick and easy to learn.
668,"Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases."
668,"During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate."
668,"You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely."
668,Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive.
668,The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action.
668,"The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports."
668,"Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels."
668,"The Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend."
668,"Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries."
668,"Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card."
668,And then it's back into the fight!
669,"Middle-Earth Quest takes place approximately ten years after Bilbo Baggins leaves the Shire, and several years before Frodo leaves Bag End on his journey leading to the destruction of the One Ring."
669,"Thus, Middle Earth Quest will take place in a time of growing darkness."
669,"Players will take control of characters such as a Gondorian Captain, a Rider from the Westfold, or numerous other character types."
669,"Not only will characters be able to experience new adventure in Middle Earth, but we will carefully seek to tie in the experience with the massive amounts of lore and story that takes place around the edges of the central THE LORD OF THE RINGS storyline."
669,Middle-Earth Quest is a game of adventure and conflict set in the time leading up to the creation of the Fellowship.

670,Build the best civilization and win the game!
670,Eminent Domain is a civilization-building game in which your civilization's abilities are based on a deck of Role cards.
670,"At the beginning of the game each player has the same deck of cards, with just two cards for each Role in it."
670,"Every turn you must choose a Role to execute (and like Glory to Rome or Puerto Rico, your opponents will get a chance to follow suit), and in doing so you will add one of those Role cards to your deck."
670,"When executing a Role, you can boost its effect by playing cards out of your hand matching the Role you have chosen."
670,"For example, the more you Research, the better you get at Researching (because you'll have more Research cards in your deck)."
671,"We’re in 19th century, sea transport is more and more important."
671,Both corporations and naval forces require newer and newer ships.

671,"Players take turns, beginning with a randomly selected player and continuing around the table clockwise."
671,"On their turn, they will choose one of the available actions from the Action Track."
671,The action will get the player something they need to help build their ships.
671,"On the player's next turn, they will move that Action Card ahead of all the others and choose a different action."
671,"If a player completes a ship on their turn (ships consists of little cards depicting bows, sterns, and (preferably several) middle pieces with several options to add equipment or crew), it is taken out for a shakedown cruise in a canal, during which they may score points for speed, crew, equipment, or safety."
671,"As players take their turns, the line of Action Cards will advance around the Action Track."
671,"When the lead Action Card reaches the Starting Space again, the countdown marker moves down one space, and play continues."
671,The game ends when the countdown marker reaches the finish space.
671,(It can also end early if the players run out of Ship Cards.)
671,"Bonus points are scored for Government Contracts, and the player with the most points wins."
671,The game lasts about 30 minutes per player.
672,"You are the founder of a new village during the middle ages, in the years after a great plague."
672,The loss of so many people has created big problems for the survivors.
672,"Many of the people the villagers used to depend on for essential things like food, shelter and clothes are gone."

673,Inferno is a standalone expansion to Arcadia Quest.
673,"It is 100% compatible with the original base game and introduces four new Guilds: Sharks, Tigers, Crows, and Serpents."
673,"It features new types of heroes, such as Alchemists and Gladiators."
673,"There is a new branching campaign system, and the storyline revolves around the guilds descending into a fiery abyss."
673,"There are Brimstone cards that make the terrain risky to navigate, which operate similarly to the Tombstone cards from Arcadia Quest: Beyond the Grave."
673,"A new mechanism called ""Damnation"" will tempt the heroes with powerful weapons that can corrupt the characters over time or change the behavior of nearby monsters."
673,"There are also Angels, which are allied characters for the heroes to rescue, escort or assist."
673,Working with the Angels can affect the branching campaign path system and even allow the player to recruit them for use in later missions.
674,This classic game of pure negotiation has taken many forms over the years.
674,"The first The Avalon Hill Game Co version has perhaps the widest release, but Avalon Hill Games, Inc. re-released the game in 1999, complete with a colorful new map and metal pieces."
674,"In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies."
674,"In the game, players represent one of the seven ""Great Powers of Europe"" (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I."
674,"Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year."
674,There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets.
674,"On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position."
674,"Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of ""orders."""
674,The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game.
674,There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance.
674,"With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers."

676,The City Council recently approved the zoning map for a new urban development — The Estates — featuring high-end infrastructure and a modern atmosphere for its citizens.
676,"Soon after, the banks awarded millions of dollars in loans to six real estate investment firms to help develop this new area."
676,"The zoning map for The Estates calls for two rows of four buildings each, located between the River and Main Street."
676,The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.
676,"But, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council's demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead."
676,"The Mayor catches wind of the potential for profit and begins planning a new mansion in The Estates, which would double the value of one of the building rows!"
676,"With some sketchy building permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone."
676,"However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: As soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there."
676,"At the end of the day, the investor with the highest-valued buildings will come out on top."
676,The players take on the role of investors seeking to make the most money by developing buildings in The Estates.
676,Players will bid for the various building pieces and place them in The Estates to their benefit.
676,"All buildings in completed rows score positive points, while all buildings in incomplete rows score negative points."
676,It is possible to have zero completed rows of buildings.
676,A game of The Estates lasts around 40 minutes and can be played in several rounds to experience a shifting economy.
677,Only once in a great while does a game dare to be truly different and abandon old concepts while striking out to chart virgin territory in game design.
677,Rarer still are the instances in which these games succeed in presenting a simulation of unparalleled realism in an easily comprehended and playable format.
677,"In UP FRONT, we have just such a game."
677,"Gone are the hexes and charts of conventional wargames; replaced by innovative and attractive game components which have distilled a wealth of technical data into one of the most playable, yet detail laden formats ever devised."
677,UP FRONT is a game of man-to-man infantry combat set in WWII Europe.
677,"In many ways, the game is more realistic than SQUAD LEADER principles in that its inherent mechanics simulate the fear and confusion of the battlefield and the inability of leadership to assert itself far better than any tactical combat game yet published."
677,There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the “hexagons” of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain.
677,"The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time."
677,"UP FRONT is a game player’s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour."
677,"However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more."
677,"Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants."
677,"Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for."
677,"In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format."
677,"The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism."
677,That’s an unbeatable combination.
677,UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).
677,"Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 & up."
677,"Each game includes: 

 162 full-colour, quality 2¼"" × 3 ½"" playing cards
 120 full-colour 2"" × 2.6"" infantry cards
 40 full-colour 2.3"" × 3.1"" AFV cards
 304 double-faced .75"", .6"", and .5"" counters
 12 scenarios with up to four variations of each
 A plastic card tray
 A 36-page rulebook containing Designer’s Notes, Historical T, O & E charts and Campaign Game Rosters."
678,Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.
678,It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).
678,"You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space."
678,The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry.
678,"The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers."
678,Each game is played as a scenario.
678,"The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive."
678,"The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all."
678,"A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed."
678,This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.
678,The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.
678,"The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity."
678,"The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions."
678,There are also rules for psychic powers.
678,There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games.
678,This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.
678,Even with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.

679,"Coal Baron – or Glück Auf in German, after a greeting German miners use when wishing one another luck – has players sending miners underground to dig tunnels and acquire coal, which comes in four levels of quality and is used to fulfill contracts."
679,"The game lasts three rounds, and in each round players take turns placing their workers on action spaces; you can place on a space occupied by another player, but you need to place additional workers in order to do so."
679,"Each player has an individual elevator shaft, and will need to use workers to extract coal and bring it to the surface, while also competing for contracts and scrounging for cash in order to do everything else that needs to be done!"
680,Empires: Age of Discovery allows you to revisit the age of exploration and discovery.
680,"Take on the role of a colonial power seeking fame, glory, and riches in the New World."
680,"As you proceed through three ages, you launch expeditions of discovery, colonize regions, expand your merchant fleet, build capital buildings that give your nation distinct advantages, develop your economy, and (if necessary) declare war."
680,Empires: Age of Discovery is a reimplementation of Age of Empires III but without that name due to the expense of renewing the license from Microsoft.
680,This edition includes the Empires: Builder Expansion along with its capital buildings; its National Advantage tiles have been built into the new player boards.
681,"In New Frontiers, a standalone game in the Race for the Galaxy family, players build galactic empires by selecting, in turn, an action that everyone may do, with only the selecting player gaining that action's bonus."
681,"The developments to be used are determined during setup, allowing players to make strategic plans based on them before play begins."
681,One group of eight developments is always in play.
681,"The game includes a suggested set of sixteen additional developments for your first game; in later games, players randomly select which side of eight double-sided ""small"" developments and eight double-sided ""large"" 9-cost developments to use during setup."
681,"Many worlds that players can acquire have special powers, with these worlds being drawn from a bag during the Explore phase."
681,"Unlike in Race, in New Frontiers worlds need colonists to be settled, in addition to either payments or conquest."
681,"Some worlds are ""windfall"" worlds and receive a good upon being settled."
681,Others are production worlds and receive goods when the Produce action is selected.
681,Goods can be traded for credits or consumed for victory points.
681,Play continues until one or more of four game ending conditions is reached.
681,"After all actions for that round have been done, the player with the most victory points from settled worlds, developments, 9-cost development bonuses, and VP chips earned from consuming goods wins."
682,"In Disney Villainous: Evil Comes Prepared, each player takes control of one of three Disney characters, each one a villain in a different Disney movie, specifically Scar from The Lion King, Yzma from The Emperor's New Groove, and Ratigan from The Great Mouse Detective."
682,"Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character."
682,"On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards."
682,"Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions."
682,You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.
682,"One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations."
682,"The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain."
682,"Disney Villainous: Evil Comes Prepared is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the Disney Villainous base game from 2018 and the Disney Villainous: Wicked to the Core standalone game in 2019."
683,"Cry Havoc is a card-driven, asymmetric, area control war game set in a brutal science fiction setting."
683,Each player commands one of four unique factions with varying abilities and units.
683,"The game includes 54 custom miniatures, a large format board, and over one hundred unique cards, all with stunning new artwork."
684,Merv: The Heart of the Silk Road is a tense economic game charting the rise and fall of the greatest city in the world.
684,"In Merv, players are vying to amass power and wealth in the prosperous heart of the Silk Road."
684,"Through careful court intrigue, timely donations to the grand mosque, and favorable trade deals, players attempt to redirect as much of that prosperity as possible into their own pockets."
684,"Meanwhile, beyond the city walls Mongol hordes approach."
684,"If you help construct the city walls, you give up on precious opportunities to build up your own stature, but leave it unprotected and you will burn with the city."
684,Every decision is weighty and the consequences of each misstep are dire.
684,Will you rise to prominence or fade into oblivion?

685,Not a trivia buff?
685,It doesn't matter!
685,"In Wits & Wagers, each player writes a guess to a question such as “In what year did the bikini swimsuit makes its first appearance?” or “How many feet wide is an NFL football field?” and places it face-up on the betting mat."
685,Think you know the answer?
685,Bet on your guess.
685,Think you know who the experts are?
685,Bet on their guess.
685,The closest answer — without going over — pays out according to the odds on the betting mat.
685,Strike it big and you'll be cheering like you just hit the jackpot!
685,Wits & Wagers is a trivia game that lets you bet on anyone's answer.
685,"So you can win by making educated guesses, by playing the odds, or by knowing the interests of your friends."
685,"It can be taught in 2 minutes, played in 25 minutes, and accommodates up to 20 people in teams."
686,Financial crisis has occurred.
686,"Sixteen ""too big to fail"" companies from four countries need bailing out."
686,"The central banks have unlimited financial resources, so lots of money is going to be printed, but the central banks also face disaster — print too much money and the country they represent goes bust."
686,"In Q.E., a term that stands for ""quantitative easing"", you play the role of a central bank."
686,You bid on different size companies to accumulate various levels of victory points.
686,The amount you bid is unlimited since you are the central bank and you own the printing press!
686,"After the initial ""open"" bid by the lead player, the other players bid in secret."
686,"After the sixteen companies have been ""bailed out"", bonus victory points are awarded for company sets of nationalization, monopolization, and diversification."
686,"Player markers on the scoring track now reveal which player has the most victory points, but this is not the end."
686,Players must now add up the amount of money they printed and the player who printed the most money loses all their victory points!
686,Previous editions of Q.E.
686,"supported up to four players, with a fifth-player expansion being available separately."
686,This new edition of Q.E.
686,is playable with up to five players out of the box.
687,"In the game Reef, players take on the role of a coral reef, carefully selecting colors and patterns in which to grow and expand."
687,"On each turn, players can choose to pick up a new card from a choice of four, or play a card that is already in hand."
687,Each card provides two reef pieces and a pattern that scores points if the existing reef has it (after placing the two new pieces).
687,Whoever has the most points when the reef pieces (or card deck) run out wins!
687,Reef is an abstract strategy game suited for players aged 8 and up.
687,"While it could take thousands of years for a coral reef to grow, a game of Reef should take only 30-45 minutes."
688,"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs."
688,This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.
688,The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.
688,"To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations."
688,"However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind."
688,"Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses."
688,"There is another option, the clock, but more on that later."
688,The action board has one other clever feature.
688,"On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last!"
688,Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.
688,"Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point."
688,"Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky."
688,Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement.
688,Extensions are appended to either end.
688,Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end.
688,All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building.
688,One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types.
688,"And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk!"
688,"Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn."
689,Levy.
689,Maneuver.
689,Conquer.
689,"The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles."
689,Each side represents a different posture – often considered to be defensive or offensive – and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn.
689,"At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture."
689,Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack.
689,"The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on."
689,"Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent's tiles."
689,"If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent's tile, you capture that tile."
689,Capture your opponent's Duke to win!
689,Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board.
689,Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke.
689,Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag.
689,"With fifteen different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and nineteen total pieces for each player (plus special optional tiles), the variety of game play is limitless."
689,"Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board."
689,"These rules also include several alternate objectives, such as the challenging Dark Rider game which pits five Pikeman against a lone Knight."
690,"In Ex Libris, you are a collector of rare and valuable books in a thriving gnomish village."
690,"Recently, the Mayor and Village Council have announced an opening for a Grand Librarian: a prestigious (and lucrative) position they intend to award to the most qualified villager!"
690,"Unfortunately, several of your book collector colleagues (more like acquaintances, really) are also candidates."
690,"To outshine your competition, you need to expand your personal library by sending your trusty assistants out into the village to find the most impressive tomes."
690,"Sources for the finest books are scarce, so you need to beat your opponents to them when they pop up."
690,"You have only a week before the Mayor's Official Inspector comes to judge your library, so be sure your assistants have all your books shelved!"
690,"The Inspector is a tough cookie and will use her Official Checklist to grade your library on several criteria including shelf stability, alphabetical order, and variety — and don't think she'll turn a blind eye to books the Council has banned!"
690,You need shrewd planning and cunning tactics (and perhaps a little magic) to surpass your opponents and become Grand Librarian!
691,"In the two-player game Caverna: Cave vs. Cave, each player starts the game with only two dwarves and a small excavation in the side of a mountain."
691,"Over the course of eight rounds, they'll double their workforce, open up new living space in the mountain, construct new buildings and rooms in which to live, and dig for precious metals."
691,"In more detail, each player starts the game with an individual player board that's covered with a random assortment of face-down building/room tiles and only one space."
691,Some tiles are face up and available for purchase at the start of play.
691,Four action tiles lie face up as well.
691,"At the start of each of the eight rounds, one new action tile is revealed, then players alternate taking actions, with the number of actions increasing from two up to four over the course of the game."
691,"As players excavate their mountainous player board, new building and room tiles are added to the pool; some rooms can be used immediately when acquired, whereas others require the use of an action tile."
691,"After eight rounds, players tally their points for buildings constructed and gold collected to see who wins."
692,"In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand."
692,"Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it."
692,"Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy."
692,"Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment."
692,Regional governments are eager to fund these projects and to invest in their implementation.
692,"If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us."
692,"In the game CO₂, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants."
692,The goal is to stop the increase of pollution while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy — and of course profiting from doing so.
692,"You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants."
692,"Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise while learning still more from others."
692,"In CO₂, each region starts with a certain number of carbon emissions permits (CEPs) at its disposal."
692,"These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project or to construct a fossil fuel power plant."
692,"CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game."
692,You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.
692,"Money, CEPs, green power plants that you've built, UN goals you've completed, company goals you've met, and expertise you've gained all give you victory points (VPs), which represent your company's reputation — and having the best reputation is the goal of the game … in addition to saving the planet, of course."
692,"This new totally re-designed edition of CO₂ features a completely new iconography, an entirely new rulebook with lots of 3D pictures for easy comprehension of the rules, more balanced gameplay, a new events deck, improved and streamlined mechanisms, and upgraded wooden components for the power plants instead of the cardboard tokens in a game with a shorter play length."
692,This version also features a co-operative mode of play as well as solo play based on goals.
693,"Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing."
693,"Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy’s capital."
693,"Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style."
693,"Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos."
693,"Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?"
693,Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering.
693,Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them.
693,"Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment."
693,"However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic."
693,Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.
693,"Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model."
693,Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser.
693,Rarity is not a factor.
693,"Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played."
693,"If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is ""burned."""
693,If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose.
693,Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things.
693,Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws.
693,Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents.
693,"Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage."
693,This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards.
693,You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.
693,"Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:
* 1 Rulebook
    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions

694,"In 1703, Czar Peter the Great founded Saint Petersburg in Russia, which quickly earned the nickname ""Paris of the East."""
694,"The Winter Palace, the Hermitage, the Church of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and many other buildings still amaze visitors from around the world today."
694,"To accomplish this, he needed a new administration and brought the aristocrats under his control."
694,This was also a golden time for the workers as their skills were much needed to reform and build the new Russia.
694,"In Saint Petersburg, players play important roles in building the city of Saint Petersburg."
694,"To do this, they will take turns selecting and purchasing cards from the display of available workers, buildings and nobles."
694,"Each type of card has an associated phase, and at the end of each phase, players earn rubles and score victory points based on the cards they have collected of that type."
694,"When one of the decks runs out, the players play until the end of that round, then the game is over."
694,"Additional victory points are awarded at the end of the game depending on the number of unique nobles that each player has, and the player with the most victory points wins the game."
694,"This new edition of Saint Petersburg features an additional optional module, the Market, which adds a new card type, the market cards, and a new game phase for them."
694,"These cards bring in new resources and not only allow for new tactical opportunities, as having a majority in a resource provides extra victory points during the market phase scoring, but also allow for a fifth player to join the game."
694,This edition also includes the two expansion modules from the original edition plus four entirely new modules.
695,"Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak takes the players to an indoor environment with vicious close-ranged fights, Prison Outbreak contains all the needed material for a new player to enter the Zombicide universe, and lots of content, almost all new, for an existing Zombicide player to expand his game experience."
695,"In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!"
695,The Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies.
695,They’re really tied to each other.
695,"Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons."
695,"You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn."
695,"This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas."
695,Prison Outbreak also contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects.
695,"These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other."
695,They’re precious assets to any Zombicide team.
695,"Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter."
695,"Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys."
695,There’s even an alternate ending.
696,"Die Tore der Welt / World Without End is based on the novel by Ken Follett, a sequel to his bestselling The Pillars of the Earth."
696,This is the 2009 game in the Kosmos line of literature-based games.
696,"World Without End shares the Kingsbridge location of the earlier novel, but occurs 200 years later."
696,"Similarly, the game shares many themes but is a new standalone game."
696,"As citizens of Kingsbridge, players need to take care of the following areas: Building, Trading, Religion, Feeding, and Medical Knowledge."
696,Each turn an event card is flipped that defines available player actions.
696,"Victory points can be won in numerous ways, e.g."
696,by creating  buildings or taking care of sick people.

697,"As a part of this maiden voyage, the corporation has agreed to let you reinvest any wealth you uncover back into training your Pod pilots, increasing their skills and efficiencies."
697,Will you be remembered as the greatest Solarus Corporation employee in the galaxy?
697,"Super Motherload is a tile-laying deck-building game, which means that you have your own deck of cards from which you draw each turn."
697,"The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it."
697,You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board.
697,You then use the minerals you've collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck.
697,"Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill."
697,Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs).
697,You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game.
697,Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.
697,"Super Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games."
698,"Blue Moon City - the board game - picks up where the two-player game, (Blue Moon), ended: the reconstruction of the destroyed city of Blue Moon."
698,"The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other."
698,"As in the 2-player game, the game includes 3 large molded plastic dragons."
698,"At the start of the game, the board tiles all show their building plan sides."
698,"The object of the game is to use cards featuring the races of Blue Moon to help rebuild the city and, at the end, put the large Crystal of the Obelisk in the middle of the city back together."
698,"Whenever a building is completely rebuilt, its tile is turned back over to its rebuilt side."
698,"The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times."
698,The player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game.
698,"(four markers in a 4-player game, five markers in a 3-player game, and six markers in a 2-player game)
There are two mini-expansions for this game (Blue Moon City: Expansion Tile Sets 1 & 2), each consisting of two tiles that can be added to the main game either separately or combined."
698,The first mini-expansion was included with the Der Knizia Almanach.
698,The second mini-expansion was included in the 6/06 issue of Spielbox.
698,"Rules changes

 Original Knizia design--after dragon scales score, ALL players discard scales."
698,This rule was modified by the publisher.
698,"[citation needed]
 In original printings such as my Kosmos and FFG for 4-3-2 players the game uses 15-12-9 dragon scales."
698,In later edtions new publisher CMON changed this to 12-9-7 scales.

702,"Humanity, through its irresponsible behavior, has exhausted the natural resources of Earth, making it almost uninhabitable."
702,"In a burst of lucidity, pressed by the irreversible degradation of your planet, the great nations are forced to put aside their differences and share their knowledge in order to create the most vast spacecraft ever constructed."
702,"Thus, the BLACK ANGEL project is launched."
702,"The Black Angel, the first intergalactic frigate in history, must transport the genetic heritage of humanity beyond known worlds, over a journey that is likely to last several thousand years."
702,Her crew will be composed of only robots.
702,"Because no nation is willing to trust creation of the AI (artificial intelligence) that will control this crew to any other nation, a compromise is found: The Black Angel will be co-managed by several AIs, and the utility of each decision will be evaluated in VP (Validation Process)."
702,"At the completion of this long and perilous voyage, when a new inhabitable planet has been reached, the AI that has earned the most VP will be entrusted with reawakening Humanity, and overseeing its new start…."
702,"All the reports are in agreement: The Black Angel is approaching Spes, a planet with the highest probability for habitability by the human species."
702,"Take advantage of our approach to maintain the good relations you have gradually woven with the benevolent Alien species populating the galaxy, and watch out for the dreaded Ravagers, who would do anything to prevent you from reaching Spes."
703,"As the subjects of a medical study, the players have checked into a lab, but while they're on time at the site, no one else seems to be there — then they realize that something seems wrong here."
703,"Steam has started emerging from one of the test tubes, and they've all gotten dizzy to the point of passing out."
703,"When they awaken, they discover that the door is locked and no other way out seems possible."
703,Only a notebook and an enigmatic spinning code dial seem to offer any clues for how to escape the lab...
703,"In Exit: The Game – The Secret Lab, players must use their team spirit, creativity, and powers of deduction to crack codes, solve puzzles, collect objects, and earn their freedom bit by bit."
703,"Extra material: It is highly recommended that you have pens/pencils, writing paper and scissors at hand when you play the game."
703,Note: There is a printing error in the first English Edition on the 2nd 'Star' clue card.
703,Please refer to the forums if you are confused after using that clue card.
704,The dragon has been asleep for many long years.
704,"In that time, the cave under which it slumbered has changed greatly…Goblins and strange monsters have filled its gloomy depths and there are whispers that the cave itself has begun thinking, shifting, and growing evermore dangerous."
704,"Still, stories of peril rarely overshadow the rumors of riches."
704,"And riches there may be… For where a dragon slumbers, there also lies a fiercely guarded treasure."
704,"Fortunately for the slumbering beast, malevolent crystals fill the cave’s rooms with spectral light, hiding the entrance to the immeasurable treasure trove."
704,Many have given their lives to the search and over the years the rumors have faded to legend.
704,But the most courageous adventurers will not be discouraged by bloodshed.
704,"On this day, a knight steps into the darkness, her gloved hand gripping the hilt of her sword."
704,Her years of quests--all of the victories and defeats--have led to this one final adventure.
704,"Knowing the kingdom can never truly be at peace with the dragon beneath the cave, she has come to make a final stand."
704,Little does she know that she will awake everything that slumbers in the shadows… and begin the final battle in the darkness.
704,Enter the world of Vast: The Crystal Caverns!
704,"Vast takes you and your friends into the torch light of a classic cave-crawling adventure, built on the concept of total asymmetry."
704,Gone are days of the merry band of travelers fighting off evil.
704,"In Vast, you will become part of a new legend... Any part you wish!"
704,"Play as the classic, daring Knight, the chaotic Goblin horde, the colossal, greedy Dragon, or even the Cave itself — powerful, brooding, and intent on crushing the living things that dare to disturb its gloomy depths."
704,"Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory...and there can be only one winner."
704,"As the ultimate asymmetric board game, Vast: The Crystal Caverns provides a limitless adventure, playable again and again as you and your friends explore the four different roles in different combinations."
704,"Play one-on-one in a race to the death between the Knight and the Goblins, or add in the Dragon and the Cave for deeper and more epic experiences, different every time."
705,"Star Trek: Fleet Captains, designed for two or four players, is set in the ""Prime Universe"" of STAR TREK (as seen in the various TV series and movies up to Star Trek: Nemesis) and is more adversarial in nature when compared to Star Trek: Expeditions."
705,Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.
705,"In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation."
705,Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding “size.”  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.
705,"Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games)."
705,Players then “shuffle build” a deck of command cards.
705,Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.
705,"Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters."
705,For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.
705,The four decks chosen will help to set the player’s strategy for winning.
705,"The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors."
705,"They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions."
705,These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.
705,"Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game."
705,"Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence)."
705,Thus a player’s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.
705,Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.
705,"The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored."
705,"As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...)."
705,"There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is “trouble with tribbles.” Some of these encounters also give victory points."
705,"Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes."
705,"Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat."
705,"Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat)."
705,"The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek."

707,There's always something happening in the city that never sleeps.
707,"Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!"
707,King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play.
707,"As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing."
707,"On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice."
707,"Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else."
707,"What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve ""Fame"", which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight."
707,The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan.
707,"When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities."
707,"Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response."
707,"The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game."
707,Part of the King of Tokyo series.
708,A group of poor explorers hoping to get rich quickly heads out to recover treasures from some undersea ruins.
708,"They're all rivals, but their budgets force them all to share a single rented submarine."
708,"In the rented submarine, they all have to share a single tank of air, as well."
708,"If they don't get back to the sub before they run out of air, they'll drop all their treasure."
708,Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.
708,"Game Objective
The game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner."
708,"In order to gain points, you must bring the most ruins chips back to the submarine."
708,"You can only return to the submarine once per round, and you cannot progress more after returning."
708,You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips.
708,"Turn Progression
On their turns, players conduct steps 1-4 listed below."
708,"Players take turns, going clockwise around the board, and the round ends when all players have returned to the submarine, or if the air runs out at the beginning of someone's turn."

709,"In Crystal Palace, players take on the role of a nation at the time of the first World Fair in London (1851), trying to create a buzz with spectacular inventions and the support of famous and powerful people."
709,Crystal Palace is a dice-placement game in which the players themselves determine the stats of their dice at the beginning of each round.
709,"The higher the number, the better — but it comes at a price."
709,"In the course of the game, dice are placed on eight action locations (Patent Office, Reform Club, London Times, Port of London, Waterloo Station, British Museum, Bank of England, Westminster) in a competition for the best resources, patents, and brains."
709,"In a world of slightly weird inventions, you will meet people like Phileas Fogg, Levi Strauss and Amelia Edwards, and invent gadgets such as the Thinking machine, the Beer glass counter or the Climate changer."
709,—description from the publisher
710,The year is 878.
710,"For the past 75 years, Viking raiding parties from Norway and Denmark have been terrorizing the coasts of England with ‘hit and run’ attacks."
710,The treasures and stories gained from these attacks have allowed the Norsemen to raise huge hosts of eager men seeking glory and riches.
710,These armies now stand poised to thunder across England where they will settle and farm the fertile land they conquer.
710,The divided English kingdoms are unprepared for this impending onslaught.
710,The Vikings are coming!
710,"In 878: Vikings – Invasions of England, players control the invading Vikings or the English nobles who are trying to withstand the invasion."
710,Viking players either play as Norsemen Viking freeman or as the fearless Viking shock troops known as Berserkers.
710,"The English play as the Housecarl, the Kings’ household troops, or as the Thegns who were regional noble Leaders."
710,"The English players will also be able to call up the peasant levies, called the Fyrd, to defend their cities."
710,Players for each side strategize together in order to coordinate their strategies.
710,Each side attempts to control Cities on the map to win.
710,The English start the game controlling all of England but a Viking Leader will invade from the sea each Turn.
710,"The English players raise reinforcements from cities they control, while the Vikings must wait for a new invasion for reinforcements."
710,The game ends when the Treaty of Wedmore is called and the side controlling the most cities wins the game.
711,"The period of the Warring States (475-221 BCE) describes a time of endless wars between seven rival states: Qin, Chu, Qi, Yan, Han, Wei, and Zhao."
711,"These states were finally unified in 221 BCE under the Qin dynasty to lay the origin of today's China, with its two main rivers: the Yellow and the Yangtze."
711,"Yellow & Yangtze, the sister game to the highly acclaimed board game Tigris & Euphrates, invites you to replay this eventful period and to lead your dynasty to victory."
711,"In Yellow & Yangtze, players build civilizations through tile placement."
711,"Players are given five different leaders: Governor, Soldier, Farmer, Trader, and Artisan."
711,The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories.
711,"However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category."
711,Conflicts arise when civilizations connect on the board.
711,"To succeed, players' civilizations must survive these conflicts, calm peasant revolts, and grow secure enough to build prestigious pagodas."
712,"Trails of Tucana is a flip-and-write game from the creators of Avenue and Doodle City that is quick and easy to play, but has enough depth to entertain gamers."
712,"Each player is given a map of the island Tucana, showing its villages and important sights."
712,"The positions of the villages are randomized for each player, so every game will provide a unique puzzle."
712,"Each turn, one player flips over two terrain cards."
712,Each player must draw — on their own map — a trail between two neighboring spaces of the shown terrains.
712,"Gradually, the trails will grow into a network of roads."
712,"Players score points by connecting matching harbors, and by connecting sights to harbors."
712,Being the first to connect a pair of harbors provides bonus points.
712,"To add depth to the game, there are varying distribution of the different terrain cards."
712,"Mountain cards are for instance rarer than desert cards, so it would be harder to build a trail through a mountain range or over water than through desert or forest."
712,Players need to take this into account when planning their routes.
712,And they should maximize the probability that they will be able to make use of any combination of terrain cards that may come up.

713,Among the Stars takes place in a war-ravaged galaxy where the warring alien races have declared peace in the wake of a threat with the potential to destroy them all.
713,"An Alliance is established to build space stations throughout the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations, and defend against this impending threat."
713,Each player takes the role of one of those races trying to build the greatest space station.
713,"Through card drafting, the players select locations, and use these to build their station, scoring victory points based on the placement."
713,"The construction lasts four years, and the alien race with the most points at the end wins."
714,"Blokus (officially pronounced ""Block us"") is an abstract strategy game with transparent, Tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board."
714,"The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board."
714,There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.
714,"Components:
Blokus Game Board (400 squares)
84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)
Each color inlcudes:

 1 one-square piece
 1 piece with 2 squares
 2 pieces with 3 squares
 5 pieces with 4 squares
 12 pieces with 5 squares

Goal of the Game:
Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible."
714,"How to Play:
1."
714,Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.
714,"The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green."
714,2.
714,The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.
714,"Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares."
714,3.
714,Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.
714,"Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners."
714,No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.
714,There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.
714,4.
714,"Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn."
714,"End of Game:
The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces."
714,This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.
714,"Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner."
714,"Scoring:
Each player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point)."
714,A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).
714,"There are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blokád (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game."
715,"After one hundred years in service, the Panama Canal still is one of the most important and impressive engineering achievements in modern times."
715,"Built in 1914, it held a prominent role in the deployment of military vessels during WWI and in the conflicts that have followed."
715,"Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world."
715,"In the wake of the Canal’s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard—designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal."
715,These ships are called PANAMAX.
715,In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Colón Free Trade Zone.
715,"Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends."
715,At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.
715,"Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system—“pushing”  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play."
715,"On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round."
715,"Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies."
715,Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing—receiving a dividend each round.
715,The questions for the players will be which companies are likely to yield higher dividends?
715,"There’s more to explore and several ways to win, but we ask that you join us at the table and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Panama Canal with a session of Panamax!"
716,The gameboard of Finca shows the mediterranean island of Mallorca.
716,"Players try to crop and deliver the fruits of Mallorca (such as oranges, lemons, almonds, grapes etc.)"
716,by means of moving workers on a traditional windmill.
716,Object of the game is to distribute your crop as effectively as possible in order to deliver faster than your opponents.
716,"From the Box: Mallorca, Island of the Wind."
716,A place of golden beaches and a light-blue sea.
716,"The almond harvest is at hand, in addition, juicy oranges, lemons, and figs are ready to be picked and taken to the market."
716,Olive trees bewitch the country with their curled branches and sumptuous vineyards invite passers-by to walk among their warm earth.
716,"In the midst of this landscape, your centuries-old natural stone farmhouse provides a home and supports your large windmill: your FINCA."
716,"Listen to the wind, which propels your windmill!"
716,Then take in the course of the yearly harvest the sweetest and most valuable fruits from the land.
716,"Load them on your old donkey cart and travel around the island, selling them everywhere."
716,"If you manage this quickly, you will soon be the richest farmer on the island."

717,The year is 1913.
717,The steamship SS Atlantica is two days out from port on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.
717,"Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to."
717,"However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse."
717,"Lurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon."
717,"For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within."
717,"Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship."
717,"If you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes."
717,"Everyone shares the same resource pool, but humans will try to preserve them while traitors will strive to subtly deplete them."
717,"Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group's resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!"
717,"At the end of each player's turn, that player must draw a mythos card."
717,Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together.
717,"Some of these crises, such as ""Food Rationing"", call for a choice that could potentially put the ship's passengers or resources at risk, while others, such as ""Hull Leak"", call for a skill test in which failure could have disastrous consequences."
717,"During a skill test, each player contributes skill cards from their hand to a face-down pile shared by the group."
717,"Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed."
717,"If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test!"
717,"But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure."
717,"Thus, skill tests are dangerous opportunities for traitors to sabotage the humans' efforts, so you have to stay on your toes at all times."

718,"Rhino Hero is back on the job — and this time not only does the wobbly skyscraper need to be climbed, but there will also be fierce battles between the four super-heroes Rhino Hero, Giraffe Boy, Big E. and Batguin."
718,"Who will win the battles and not let themselves be bothered by the mean, hanging spider monkeys?"
718,Rhino Hero: Super Battle is a turbulent 3D stacking game.
719,A cooperative game of adventure for 1-5 players set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons.
719,It is named after the book series by the same name recounting the adventures of the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden and his friends.
719,"Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative game play."
719,"Players explore the game world, which is built during the game by laying out tiles, using ready-made player characters and encountering enemies with corresponding miniatures."
719,Encounters are generated by drawing cards and resolved using a D20 die.
719,"All players win together, depending on the scenario, by escaping, saving others or overcoming a threat."
720,"(from GMT's website:)
Washington’s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People."
720,"Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence."
720,Washington’s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes).
720,"Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting."
720,This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet.
720,Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.
720,Washington’s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play.
720,The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card.
720,"Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy."
720,"The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides."
720,The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions.
720,The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention.
720,"While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field."
720,In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War.
720,Washington’s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition.
720,"What was old is new again...be the man on the white horse and father a new nation, or be a king trying to save his empire during a world war."
720,"COMPONENTS:

(BGG description:)
Washington’s War is a card-driven game on the American Revolution."
720,It pits the forces of King George III against the American colonists as they fight for their independence.
720,"In Washington’s War, you assume the role of either:

 The King of Great Britain as he tries to bring his rebellious colonies back into the Empire, while at the same time dealing with a global war against ancient enemies bent on revenge for their losses in the Seven Years War; OR
 The Continental Congress as they battle the forces of Britain, while trying to rally their countrymen to the cause of liberty."
720,"Washington’s War is not just a re-tread of my earlier design on the same subject, but a true re-design that is keeping the basic feel while simplifying and speeding up what was already a fast paced game."
720,Washington’s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to internet play.
720,The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that enables a player to play a discarded event for the cost of an operations card.
720,Now unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers to push your strategy forward.
720,Washington’s War is being broadly tested on the internet to give players a voice and a source of input prior to publication.
720,What was old is new again….
720,Be the man on the white horse and forge a nation or save an empire.
721,Dogs of War is an elegant game set in a steampunk-influenced renaissance universe.
721,"Noble houses engage each other in a series of fierce battles, and it's up to the players and the Dogs of War they control to deploy their private armies in support of whatever house they wish to favor."
721,"Clockwork knights and imposing war machines shift the tides of war as they enter the battlefields, but the interest of their Dog of War captains actually lie in the rewards offered by each noble house to its supporters."
721,"Each Dog of War has a special ability that helps them claim influence, win battles, or betray the house to which they've sworn allegiance!"
721,"Dogs of War is not a game of pure military power, but rather a game in which deception and betrayal often lead the way to a decisive victory."
721,The goal for the Dogs of War is to earn the most power by the end of the game.
721,"Thanks to thoughtful game design and development, there are many ways to achieve this, like defeating other captains in battle, getting rewards from the Houses you help, amassing gold and troops, and most importantly, gaining influence with the most successful Houses."
722,"""You are Abelard Lavel, a knight sworn to King Charles VI the Beloved."
722,You live in the city of Paris in a family mansion not far from the famous Notre Dame cathedral.
722,"Since you were a child, you had strange, prophetic dreams in which you saw violent scenes of past crimes or even ones yet to be committed."
722,Over time you learned that your unusual gift could be put to good use and you started to solve cases that nobody else could crack.
722,"This earned you some reputation in the city and now people seek your help whenever a mysterious crime is committed."""
722,The Chronicles of Crime: 1400 standalone game brings back well-known mechanisms of the original Chronicles of Crime game while adding some new twists.
722,Now you can deduce not only from the evidence you find or the testimonies given by various characters but also from the mysterious scenes depicted on new Vision Cards.
722,These scenes can be either from the future or from the past and they usually involve characters and objects yet to be revealed.
722,"During your investigation, you can also count on your family members to share their knowledge with you."
722,"You can ask your uncle, a monk who has a wealth of knowledge about written texts, your sister a merchant who knows something about almost any object you’ll find or even your brother, a king’s spy, who knows a story or two about many of the people you will meet."
722,"Finally, your faithful dog is always willing to trace a suspect for you, just bring him an item belonging to the person in question and he’ll track them down!"
722,"Part of Chronicles of Crime - The Millennium Series
Chronicles of Crime is back with a range of games called ""The Millennium Series""."
722,"Three brand new standalone Chronicles of Crime games, working with the same great system but providing interesting gameplay twists and refreshing universes that span an entire millennium from 1400 to 1900 and finally 2400."
722,All three games are standalone but will offer connecting narrative threads for players to discover.
723,"In the multiplayer puzzle game Railroad Ink, your goal is to connect as many exits on your board as possible."
723,"Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players."
723,"You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents."
723,"The more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully!"
723,"Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?"
723,"Railroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add special rules to your games."
723,The Blazing Red Edition includes the Lava and  Meteor expansions.
723,"Try to confine the lava coming from the erupting volcano before it destroys your routes, or deal with the havoc brought by the meteor strikes and mine the craters for precious ore."
723,These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different.
723,"Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more)."
723,The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!
724,"Heroes of Land, Air & Sea is a 4X-style board game with miniatures that tells the epic tale of orcs vs. humans, dwarves vs. elves, battling kingdoms, and the individuals who turn the tides of war."
724,"Players control one of these classic factions, competing to expand their kingdom into new territory."
724,"Even the greatest kingdoms begin as small townships, therefore players begin with only a basic town hall, a couple of peons, and a single warrior."
724,"From there, players must explore the territory around them, build up their work force, fortify their army, and develop their kingdom — all through careful action selection, exploitation, war, and resource management."
724,"As players reach milestones in the development of their kingdom, they gain access to many advantages."
724,"Peons become warriors, warriors become powerful heroes, and town halls eventually become castles."
724,"Players gain access to water, and even air, vessels and creatures."
724,Boarding these vessels and creatures with your units allows for faster travel across the vast game board and for positioning armies for powerful attacks.
724,"War in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea features a cost/reward system carefully detailed on tactics cards from which players must secretly choose."
724,The availability of these tactics cards depends on the units participating in the war.
724,It is here that players wage their wits and legacy in an attempt to exterminate one another.
724,"For as we all know, ""history is written by the victors""."
724,"Heroes of Land, Air & Sea also boasts two economic systems, one being the risky acquisition and careful management of the resources (food, ore and mana), while the other is a twist on worker placement that requires the leveraging of peons to construct buildings, peons that could otherwise be exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating!"
724,Finding this balance is crucial to victory!
725,"A shot disturbs the eerie silence of a deserted city street, punctuated by the frantic footfalls of men seeking cover."
725,One of Kruger’s last veteran nco’s lies motionless in the street.
725,The remnants of the dead man’s squad are nowhere to be seen—scattered in nearby houses and gutters—all thoughts of the advance abandoned with the sudden demise of their leader...the compulsion for revenge obviously overcome by their instinct for self-preservation.
725,"Off to the right, Kruger’s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead."
725,The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort.
725,Kruger has seen enough.
725,He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once.
725,His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper.
725,He gives the signal to rush the building.
725,"Obedient to their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet."
725,"Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes with the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong..."
725,This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe.
725,"Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader."
725,"YOU direct the fire of your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armor assaults."
725,"Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods?"
725,The decision is irrevocable and yours alone.
725,You must live or die by the results.
725,Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity.
725,The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes.
725,A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows your own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability.
725,"In addition, a “Design Your Own” section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation."
725,"Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads."
725,"Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time."
725,"Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action."
725,Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games.
725,"Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more."
725,Be forewarned!
725,Squad Leader is not an easy game.
725,Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience.
725,Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H.
725,Complexity scale.
725,"In each game you get:

520 two-sided ½” die cut counters representing the men and weapons of the German, Russian, and American armies of WWII."
725,192 two-sided ⅝” die cut counters representing fortifications and individual vehicles of the combatants.
725,"Big 22” x 28” four section, full-colour GEOMORPHIC mapboard which can be arranged to make literally hundreds of different terrain configurations that can represent large cities, small villages, wooded hillsides, or even the flat plains of the Ukraine."
725,"Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page rules of play and designer’s notes booklet."
725,Scenario cards for the first 12 carefully constructed game situations.
725,Two highly refined Quick Reference Data Cards which reduce the complexities of a realistic infantry combat game into easily playable proportions.
726,"Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe — which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in."
726,"As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so."
726,"When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends."
726,"At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead."
726,"Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck)."
726,"Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like."
726,(Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)
726,"Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game."
726,"To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens."
726,"Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces."
726,"You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap."
726,Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities.
726,"If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network."
726,Each player also starts the game with three harbors.
726,"If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port)."
726,"To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor)."
726,"At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city."
726,"Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America."
726,"Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay."
726,Part of Ticket to Ride series.
727,"Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed 2-4 player card game."
727,Players take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia.
727,"These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens."
727,"But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy."
727,"Summoner Wars: Alliances Master Set, a big box starter set for Summoner Wars akin to the Summoner Wars Master Set, features eight complete faction decks and can be played on its own or combined with other Summoner Wars products."
727,"All sixteen factions in the SW world are represented as each new summoner is a hybrid of two existing factions, blending the themes of the two factions and expanding deck-building possibilities."
727,"The factions are:

Fallen Phoenix: Phoenix Elves/Fallen Kingdom
Cave Filth: Filth/Cave Goblins

730,"From the mind of the highly acclaimed designer of Die Macher, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, the gameplay in Tribune  is a combination of worker placement and set collection."
730,"Each round, the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives, and/or attempt to take over factions."
730,"In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group."
730,That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values.
730,"Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants."
730,"Alternatively, you can choose to forego the use of a condition card and play with the point-value option."
730,"In this variant, the game ends when someone has collected a certain number of the faction markers, and the winner is the one with the highest scores as determined by the points assigned to each achievement."

735,"Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g."
735,"""there are ten sixes""."
735,"However, someone can always contest the bid."
735,"When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct."
735,The last player with dice is the winner.
735,"As a public domain dice game, there are a number of variants or similar games called Liar's Dice."
735,"This includes one that is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values."

737,"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible."
737,There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board.
737,There are also color-coded targets on boards.
737,Placed on top of the surface are four robots.
737,The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target.
737,"The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it."
737,"Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves."
738,"Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships."
738,"And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory."
738,"This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:
Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board."
738,"A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs."
738,"When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number."
738,"In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money."
738,Each round there is a window of ships.
738,"The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew."
738,"Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top."
738,"In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship."
738,"The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won."
738,"A brief description from the rule book:
Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India."
738,"Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches."
738,"To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut."
738,"For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points)."
738,"The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn."
738,"Ships at landings that are ""complete"" at the end of the round (i.e."
738,"reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing."
738,This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.
738,"During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, or Purchase Projects or Characters)."
738,Planning is fundamental: The right to take an Action could be free of charge or paid for.
738,"The earlier a Player plans to take an Action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it."
738,Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area.
738,Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge Action for each Round.
738,He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them.
738,This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters.
738,"Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players."
738,"Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points, and Manuel 1st (The King) will allow Players to take an additional Action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom."
738,The winner is the Player with the highest Victory Points score at the end of the game.
739,"From the back of the box (edited for grammar):

739,"In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered."
739,"And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer."
739,"By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans."
739,The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.
739,The game's attraction lies with the many special cards.
739,"Many different combinations are possible during the game, and each game plays out differently as a result."

740,"To achieve this, players have to cater to the citizens' needs and — most importantly — offer proper housing for everyone."
740,This means that promoting the building activities in town will be one of the major tasks of the candidates.
740,"Crown of Emara skillfully combines card actions with worker movement actions, allowing players to plan their turns carefully during their downtime."
740,"The two counselors available to every player move in two separate roundabouts, requiring players to optimize every move."

742,"Game description from the publisher:
You are humanity's last hope."
742,"In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM."
742,"It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion."
742,"Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed."
742,"To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you."
742,"You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base — all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good."
742,One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay.
742,This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.
742,"The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans."
742,"Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth."
742,The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time.
742,"Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app."
742,"Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes."
742,"Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard."
742,The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure.
742,"While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase."
742,"As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts."
742,"Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world’s crises before you know how many troops you’ll need to commit to your base defense."
742,"The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other."
742,"Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail."

744,Will you survive the dangers of Artemia?

744,"If you play as one of the Hunted, you will explore Artemia using Place cards."
744,"By playing these and Survival cards, you try to avoid, confuse or distract the Creature until help arrives."
744,"If you play as the Creature, you will stalk and pursue the shipwrecked survivors."
744,"By playing your Hunt cards and using the mysterious powers of Artemia, you try to wear down the Hunted and assimilate them to the planet forever."
744,"NOT ALONE is a immersive, thematic card game, where you use guessing, bluffing, hand management, and just a pinch of deck-building to achieve your goal, which is survival for the Hunted... or total assimilation for the Creature!"

746,To be successful players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the 'consumed' polyp tiles that are the key to the game.
746,The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses (and have a similar effect to the action points in games like Tikal and Java).

747,"Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives."
747,"One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies."
747,Detective: CoA uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect.
747,Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer.
747,"When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time?"
747,"Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve."
747,"Detective: CoA includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel."
747,Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations.
747,"As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and ""hot"" leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience."
747,"Inspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A."
747,"Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a murder-mystery game unlike any other."
747,Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.'s latest high profile murder?
747,Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime?
747,"—description from the publisher
A ""sleuth"" mode allows 1 or more players to play fully cooperatively, solving the cases together."
748,"In ZÈRTZ, the third addition to the GIPF Project, players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls."
748,"This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board."
748,A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board.
748,"In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel."
748,This game is part of project GIPF.
749,"The rules of ""Red"" are simple: highest card wins!"
749,"But ""Red"" is just one of seven games you'll be playing in Red7, and if you're not winning the current game at the end of your turn, you're out!"
749,The last person standing wins the round.
749,The deck in Red7 is 49 cards: each of the colors of the rainbow numbered 1 to 7.
749,A hand takes just a couple minutes!
750,The Magnificent is a tightly designed Eurogame from the creators of Santa Maria set in a mystical world beautifully illustrated by French artist Martin Mottet.
750,"In the game, players are competing to attract the largest audiences to their shows, featuring magnificent performers."
750,"In the process, you must expand your camp by placing Tetris-style tiles on your player board, gather elements needed for the shows, and set up performances in your tents."
750,"On your turn, you take one die from the supply."
750,The value of the chosen die is your strength.
750,"Add to this the value of all dice of the same color that you have already collected, then use this strength to carry out one of three main actions: build, travel or perform."
750,"The more strength you have, the better the action will be, but at the end of the round, you must pay — in coins — the total of your highest-valued dice color."
750,"Thus, taking dice of the same color makes for better actions, but will cost more coins."
750,"After each player has taken four turns, the round ends."
750,Each player must discard one of their ringmaster cards and score points according to its requirements.
750,"After three rounds, the game ends, and the player who has collected the most points wins."
750,"In more detail, players start the game with four ringmaster cards and a unique trainer tile."
750,Each ringmaster card provides a special ability (which is triggered when you place a die on it) and a unique end-of-round scoring opportunity.
750,"When you choose a ringmaster card to discard and score at the end of the round, you must therefore also take into consideration which special abilities you want to keep."
750,"In addition to your main action, you may use trainers on your personal unique trainer tiles or on common trainer spaces on the game board for various benefits."
750,"At the end of each round, in order of the players' highest-ranked performances, players choose a new ringmaster card and a trainer tile, providing new abilities and scoring opportunities for the next round."
751,Whistle Stop designer Scott Caputo has teamed up with Luke Laurie (Manhattan Project: Energy Empire) to create a new worker-placement strategy title.
751,"Whistle Mountain gives a nod to Whistle Stop, but in this standalone game, you leave the train tracks behind and head to the sky with blimps, dreadnoughts, and hot air balloons!"
751,"In Whistle Mountain, take your company's massive profits from all of that railroading and invest them in new technologies, deep in the Rocky Mountains where there is an abundance of resources."
751,"Your workers build crazy arrays of scaffolds and machines, upgrading your abilities and collecting resources."
751,"As you build with the help of your airship fleet, the mountain's melting snow causes the water below to rise higher and higher, putting workers in danger and increasing the tension on the dynamically-changing board."
751,"Because the resources you gather are determined by what players build, each game evolves differently, resulting in endless replayability."
751,You have to choose between acquiring new abilities and enhancements for your airships and workers or building all sorts of contraptions as quickly as possible in order to achieve victory on Whistle Mountain.
751,—description from the publisher
752,Combat Commander:Pacific is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the Pacific Theater of World War II.
752,"CC:P's main theme is the addition of three new factions to the Combat Commander family:

Imperial Japan
the Pacific US - with a strong emphasis on the US Marine Corps
the Pacific Commonwealth - focusing on Indian and ANZAC forces


CC:P is a stand alone game in the card-driven Combat Commander game series."
752,"While utilizing Combat Commander: Europe's basic rules, CC:P includes numerous rule tweaks and additions in order to more accurately portray tactical warfare as experienced by the participants in and around the Pacific and Indian Oceans."
752,This slightly ramps up the complexity of the Combat Commander series while at the same time imparting a bit more depth and realism.
752,"Just a few of the additions include:
Banzai attacks;
BARs and Thompson SMGs;
Beach landings & river crossings;
Hidden movement;
Caves;
Scouts;
Aircraft;
Bayonets;
Mortar spotting;
Treetop snipers;
Reconnoitering."
752,SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet across (about 30 meters).
752,Each complete Player Turn abstractly represents several seconds of real time.
752,Each complete Game Turn abstractly represents several minutes of real time.
752,"UNITS: Due in part to the unique composition of late-war USMC squads and the imbedding of specialized weapon teams within IJA squads, the units in the game are represented by 4-6 man Teams and 8-13 man Squads."
752,Radios — and individual weapons larger than a rifle — are represented by their own counters.
752,Individual Aircraft are also represented with their own counters.
752,VICTORY: Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent’s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible.
752,"The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario’s specific Objective chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent’s board edge."
752,GAME FLOW: A game of Combat Commander is divided into several Time segments.
752,"There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card ""Orders"" conducted by the active player."
752,"Fate Card ""Actions"" may generally be conducted by either player at any time."
752,"""Events"" and die roll ""Triggers"" — both good and bad — will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player’s perfect plan."
752,CC:P includes twelve maps featuring terrain specific to the PTO.
752,"CC:P's playbook includes:

twelve scenarios."
752,Pacific version of the Random Scenario Generator utilizing the new maps and nationalities.
752,"This random scenario system provides an almost unending variety of map configurations, force structures, and combat situations."

NOTE: Combat Commander:Pacific is a stand-alone game."
752,"You do NOT need to own any other Combat Commander game in order to play it, though familiarity with the system would be a plus."
753,"Conflict of Heroes is a fast-paced tactical board game series that follows the development of modern day squad and platoon level tactics, starting with World War II and continuing all the way through modern day Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan."
753,"The first game in the series, Awakening the Bear!"
753,"– Russia 1941-1942, takes you to the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of Russia."
753,Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.
753,Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames.
753,The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience.
753,"You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units."
753,"This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time."
753,Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses.
753,"For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training."
753,All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.
753,"The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle."
753,You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in ten minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook.
753,The game also features three- and four-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play.
754,Gentes is an interesting civilization game with an innovative timing mechanism.
754,"""Gentes"" is a pleonasm of the Latin plural word for greater groups of human beings (e.g., tribes, nations, people; singular: ""gens"")."
754,"In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea."
754,"The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up."
754,"There are three eras — rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 — with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5."
754,Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers.
754,"In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn."
754,Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track.
754,"Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track."
754,"When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round."
754,"Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers."
754,"Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round."
754,"The actions are:

Buy new cards from the common display
Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)
Train/Educate your people
Build/found cities
Take money

To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers)."
754,"These requirements are why training — i.e., getting specific people — is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people — three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board — and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line."
754,"If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers."
754,"By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space."
754,It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built.
754,"Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead."
754,Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money.
754,"Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III."
754,Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols.
754,Build cities to enlarge your options!
754,"The differences between the Deluxified and regular edition:
Includes ""New Cities"" Expansion
A foil stamped box
6 oversized meeples
24 normal sized meeples

755,"France 1831: In a remote corner of Ardèche, the little village of Peyrebeille sees numerous travelers pass through."
755,"A family of greedy rural farmers is determined to make its fortune and has devised a diabolical stratagem to achieve this goal: Invest in an inn so they can rob traveling guests, getting rich without arousing the suspicions of the police!"
755,"Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive."
755,"The Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers."
755,"At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests."
755,Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card.
755,"Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded."
755,"Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses."
755,"A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order."
755,"Players choose one of the following actions:

 bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)
 build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)
 kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)
 bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim's pockets)
 launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)

At the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly — and quietly — bury the bodies!"
755,"Lastly in the round, any cards (accomplices) in each player's hand must be paid 1F each."
755,"After the guest deck has been depleted the second time, players take a final round, then tally their francs."
755,The player with the most money wins!
756,The town of Scoville likes it hot!
756,Very hot!
756,That means they love their peppers – but they're too busy eating them to grow the peppers themselves.
756,That's where you come in.
756,You've been hired by the town of Scoville to meet their need for heat.
756,Your role as an employee of Scoville is to crossbreed peppers to create the hottest new breeds.
756,"You'll have to manage the auctioning, planting, and harvesting of peppers, then you'll be able to help the town by fulfilling their orders and creating new pepper breeds."
756,Help make the town of Scoville a booming success!
756,Let's get planting!
756,"A round of Scoville consists of a blind auction, which determines player order, a planting phase, a harvesting phase, and a fulfillment phase."
756,"Each round, the players plant peppers in the fields."
756,"Throughout the game, the available opportunities for crossbreeding increase as more peppers are planted."
756,"When harvesting, players move their pawn through the fields, and whenever they move between two planted fields, they harvest peppers."
756,"If, for example, they harvest between fields of red and yellow peppers, they crossbreed those and harvest an orange pepper."
756,Harvested peppers are then used to fulfill the town's peppery desires!
757,"Edo — what we now know today as Tokyo, Japan — was a thriving city with an estimated population of one million, half townspeople and half samurai."
757,"With a huge shopping culture, Edo's main district, Nihonbashi, was lined with shops, selling kimonos, rice, and so much more."
757,"Nihonbashi is the focus of IKI: A Game of EDO Artisans, which brings you on a journey through the famed street of old Tokyo."
757,Hear the voices of Nihonbashi Bridge's great fish market.
757,"Meet the professionals, who carry out 700­-800 different jobs."
757,Enter the interactivity of the shoppers and vendors.
757,Become one with the townspeople.
757,One of the main professions in the world of Edo is the artisan.
757,Each of the Edo artisans uses their own skill of trade to support the townspeople's lives.
757,"In this game, not only are there artisans, but street vendors, sellers at the shops, and professions unique to this time and age."
757,"Meet the puppet masters, putting on a show."
757,Meet the ear cleaners that people would line up for.
757,"The goal of this game is to become the annual Edoite, best personifying what is known as ""IKI"", an ancient philosophy believed to be the ideal way of living among people in Edo."
757,"Knowing the subtleties of human nature, being refined and attractive — these are all elements of a true IKI master."
758,"In this Sid Sackson classic, players must press their luck with dice and choose combinations tactically to close out three columns."
758,"The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete."
758,"On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 & 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 & 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 & 9."
758,"The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color."
758,"A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn’t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn’s progress lost."
758,"A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game."
759,Defeat Prussia before the Tsarina dies!
759,"Or be Frederick the Great and struggle for survival with a mixture of courageous willpower, sudden inspiration and stoic patience."
759,It is the summer of 1756.
759,"On the eve of the Seven Years War, half of Europe has formed an alliance."
759,Frederick the Great is in deep sorrow: Is the annihilation of Prussia planned?
759,Is it Prussia's defeat or is it Prussia's glory?
759,All against one – but only one will reign supreme.
759,"On a map of Old Europe, players maneuver their generals from city to city."
759,"Frederick must retain a part of each Prussian province, while the attacking powers savagely seek out their objectives."
759,The clever use of tactical cards is decisive to winning.
759,Histogame and Richard Sivél present Friedrich as a novel concept uniting the fascination of board and card games.
759,"Accurately based on history while maintaining a slim set of rules, Friedrich offers wide open spaces for chess-like moves and great depth for decision making."
759,"Taken into Frederick's era, you will reflect on tactical finesses, smile about interspersed anecdotes, and be perplexed at how often you are not able to count to three..."
759,Note: A common misconception is that Friedrich has player elimination based on the cards of fate making countries leave the game.
759,"The game does not have player elimination; it has country elimination, and a player could end up controlling fewer countries than they started with, but players are never eliminated by the cards of fate."
759,"Friedrich FAQ
Details on the Jubiläumsedition
In 2011 Histogame released a slightly revised version of Friedrich, dubbed the ""Jubiläumsedition"" or ""Anniversary Edition"" in honor of Friedrich's 300th birthday."
759,"Designer Richard Sivél notes the following differences between this edition and earlier ones:

 New cover art."
759,Four color images for the patterns of the cards.
759,"Small rearrangements of cities on the map, such as Falkenau (in northwestern Austria) moving into the spades sector and Gollnow (close to Stettin) getting a diamonds-city neighbor."
759,Minor adjustment of some fate cards to clarify the wording.
759,More details: on this webpage
760,The Mind is more than just a game.
760,"It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game."
760,"In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players."
760,"In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc."
760,Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold.
760,"You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card."
760,"If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues!"
760,"If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life."
760,You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players.
760,"Lose all your lives, and you lose the game."
760,"You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level."
760,"As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life."
760,"Complete all the levels, and you win!"
760,"For an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down."
760,"You don't look at the cards played until the end of a level, losing lives at that time for cards played out of order."
761,"(from GMT website:)
Empire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman's third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People."
761,EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan.
761,"EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG."
761,"Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia."
761,This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.
761,"As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent."
761,The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices.
761,The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance.
761,The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.
761,"Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system."
761,"The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat."
761,The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.
761,The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will.
761,"The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically."
761,"The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States."
761,"The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan."
761,It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.
761,"EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind."
761,"EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours."
761,"If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction."
761,"If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability."
761,"The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn."
761,"TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn
MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex
UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army

(from the designer:)
Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system."
761,"The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia."
761,"EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges."
761,"Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign."
761,"The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc."
761,"), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level."
761,The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.
761,The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat.
761,"The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2."
761,"This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like."
761,"As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale."
761,"This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive."
761,Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs.
761,"If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war."
761,"Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently."
761,Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.
762,"(From the publisher)
Napoleon’s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale."
762,"It uses two boards to make a double-size 44"" x 34"" map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon’s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening."
762,"From Back of Box
On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander."
762,"Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history."
762,Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle.
762,"Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44"" x34"" map of the battlefield."
762,"In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play."
762,"The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours."
762,"Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening."
762,"The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo."
762,"Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions."
762,It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself.
762,It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential.
762,It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.
762,Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience.
762,"It is large, yet fast-playing."
762,"It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail."
762,"It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy."
762,"Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality."
762,"The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards."
762,"To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies."
762,Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit.
762,The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.
762,"In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps."
762,The effect is simply stunning.
763,"Description from the publisher:
A 1-6 player cooperative game of terrifying cave escape."
763,"Players take the role of amateur cavers attempting to escape an unexplored network of subterranean tunnels, before the lights flicker out or the darker things beneath the Earth catch up to them..."
763,"In Sub Terra players spend their turn exploring and revealing the tunnel system around them, attempting to survive the various perils of the cave, from floods and cave ins to gas leaks and scree."
763,"Players each have a role which gives them specialist abilities, such as an Engineer with dynamite to blast a new route or a Scout to find a route more easily."
763,"New tiles are placed from a randomised stack of cave features, which determines whether you'll be hit with a dead end or a range of new options."
763,"At the end of each turn, players face the reality of their situation, with a hazard card drawn to determine what danger causes them damage or cuts off their way out of the horror below."
763,"These cards are finite, and when they run out, your torches flicker and the air feels tight, and your chance of survival diminishes quickly."
764,Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men is a collectible dice-building tabletop game designed by Quarriors!
764,creators Michael Elliott and Eric M. Lang.
764,"In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero — Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and more — being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of up to 20 dice, and a player can ""purchase"" dice only from his team."
764,"Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls."
764,"Different versions of these cards will be available in booster packs, allowing for more customization of your team."
764,"Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head."
764,"In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards."
764,A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.
764,"The Marvel Dice Masters: Avengers vs. X-Men starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook."
764,Booster packs include two dice with two matching character cards.
765,"As a tight-knit team in Menara, players use pillars and wondrously-shaped temple floors to build a spectacularly soaring structure full of nooks and crannies."
765,"Cooperation and static skills are in demand since for each mistake in construction, you have to add another floor to the temple."
765,"A steady hand, an alert mind, and mutual assistance can help you successfully complete what seems to top out at dizzy heights..."
766,"In Dice Hospital, a worker placement game, players must treat as many patients as possible to appease the local authorities!"
766,Players use their hospital staff to treat patients on their personal hospital player boards.
766,"However, players may also call in specialist staff to react to certain situations that arise to score more points with the authorities!"
766,"The game uses worker placement mechanics for the staff, dice as the patients where low scores indicate low health and a personal player board of actions to treat patients."
766,The player with the highest reputation wins the game!
767,It is a dark time for the galaxy.
767,The Galactic Empire has consolidated its dominion through the might of the Imperial Navy.
767,"In the underworld of the Empire's most populated planets, and in strongholds throughout the Outer Rim, powerful gangsters rule vast criminal organizations."
767,"From the shadows, those lost to the grip of the dark side of the Force scheme to bring their evil designs to bear on an already oppressed galaxy."
767,Yet not all hope is lost.
767,The Rebel Alliance resists the iron grip of the Empire.
767,Smugglers and other fringe elements lend their aid to the Rebellion.
767,"And unknown to the Emperor and his dark minions of the Sith, the last remnants of the noble Jedi Order work tirelessly to restore peace and order to the galaxy."
767,"Star Wars: The Card Game is a two-player card game that puts one player in command of the Rebels (light side, with the factions Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies), and one player in command of the Empire (dark side, with the factions Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy)."
767,The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games.
767,The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy.
767,"Each player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates."
767,Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards.
767,"Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck."
767,"Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle."
767,"The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game."
767,"It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects."
767,The Rebels win by destroying three dark side objectives before the Empire wins.
767,Contains objective sets 1-36.
768,"Spyfall is a party game unlike any other, one in which you get to be a spy and try to understand what's going on around you."
768,It's really simple!
768,"Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location — a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station — except that one player receives a card that says ""Spy"" instead of the location."
768,"Players then start asking each other questions — ""Why are you dressed so strangely?"""
768,"or ""When was the last time we got a payday?"""
768,or anything else you can come up with — trying to guess who among them is the spy.
768,"The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully."
768,"When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!"
768,"At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy."
768,"If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity."
768,"If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points."
768,"However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points."
768,"After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!"
769,Puzzling and animal breeding: Designer Uwe Rosenberg is at his best!
769,"In New York Zoo, you are constructing an animal park."
769,"Build animal enclosures, introduce new animals and raise their offspring."
769,The game play is straight forward as you have only two turn options: Puzzle a new enclosure tile into your zoo area or gain new animals to populate your animal encounters.
769,But be sure to time your actions well since you want your zoo to participate in as many animal breedings as possible.

770,"In Celestia, a revamped version of Cloud 9, you board an aircraft with a team of adventurers to perform many trips through the cities of Celestia and recover their wonderful treasures."
770,"Your journey will not be safe, but you will attempt to be the richest adventurer by collecting the most precious treasures!"
770,"At the beginning of a journey, all players place their pawns within the aircraft; the players start the game with six cards in hand (or eight depending on the number of players)."
770,"At the beginning of each round, one player is chosen to be the captain of the trip and he rolls 2-4 dice to discover the challenges that they will face: fog, lightning bolts, killer birds, or pirates."
770,"He must then play the appropriate cards — a compass, a lightning arrester, a foghorn, or even cannons — to continue on the journey and reach the next city."
770,"But before the captain plays the appropriate cards, each player must decide whether to stay within the aircraft:

 If you exit, you're guaranteed the victory points that come from exploring the current city."
770,"If you stay on board, you hope to make it to the next city in order to catch more precious treasures."
770,"If the captain can't overcome the challenge, though, everyone comes crashing down empty-handed and you'll need to begin a new trip with all passengers on board."
770,"During the journey, each adventurer can try to pull out of the game with fabulous objects (a jetpack, astronomy glasses, etc.)"
770,or by changing the trip (modifying the travel or abandoning an explorer in the city).
770,"As soon as a player earns treasure worth at least fifty points, the game ends and this player wins."

773,"Spyrium is set in an alternate world, an England set in a steampunk-based universe."
773,"Players build factories, needing workers to manage the production of a commodity previously unknown to us called ""Spyrium""."
773,"Producing Spyrium in one factory, then processing it in the next results in victory points (VPs) for that particular player."
773,"Alternatively, Spyrium can be purchased, but the material is rare and expensive, and players are constantly scraping for money."
773,Only those who from the beginning of the game manage to increase their regular income or their base of permanently employed workers (who can be used again and again to raise money) will be flexible enough to get their hands on the important end-of-game buildings to generate many VPs.
773,The circular nature of the game is flexible as each player can decide for himself when to move out of the placement phase and into the activation phase.
773,"With the two tracks in the game, those involved with delivery during the worker phase can then be used to raise money, to purchase an adjacent card, or to work on their own in an idle factory."
773,"All of these things are important, but in the end only the player who has dealt best with the lack of money, workers, and Spyrium will win."

776,"After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city."
776,"Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy."
776,Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations.
776,"While the organization's influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 – the era of Boss Tweed."

780,Each player's doom constantly changes as they draw numbered fate tiles from the bag.
780,"By choosing which fate to give up and which card to play it on, you can give your allies enough information to identify the fate you're holding...which is important, as the active player cannot communicate with their allies during their turn!"
780,Each card has strict rules governing what fates can be played on it.
780,"As doom builds up, the cards themselves fade, becoming one-time powers to help the players while new cards cycle in from the deck."
780,"Skilled play requires carefully rationing powers, hints, and cycling, while paying attention to not only where each fate was played -- but more importantly, where it wasn't."
780,"The rotating active player creates a different group dynamic each turn, preventing any one player from dominating the game."
780,Inexperienced players can still use the group deduction phase to ask questions (while they are not the active player).

781,Players build up the old town together by placing tiles.
781,"While the town area grows, the town walls grow around it, starting from a wooden gate."

781,This brings the players extra points.

783,"Diamant — also published as Incan Gold — is a quick, fun press-your-luck game."
783,"Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card."
783,"Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out."
783,Why would you leave?
783,"Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls."
783,"When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety."
783,"The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper — but at the risk of ending up with nothing."
783,"All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once."
783,"When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path."
783,"If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game."
784,"Build the city’s greatest theme park, whatever it takes!"

785,The mythical realm of Hyperborea was ruled by an ancient civilization that used magical crystals as their main source of energy.
785,"With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods."
785,"Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier."
785,"When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land."
785,The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier.
785,"The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten."
785,"Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign."
785,The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last.
785,"One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed."
785,"A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore."
785,"Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail?"
785,Brutal strength or deep understanding of science?
785,"The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities?"
785,"Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!"
785,"Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player."
785,The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.
785,Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land.
785,"Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea."
785,"During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc..."
785,"The game's main mechanism, which can be described as ""bag-building"", involves you building a pool of ""civilicubes""."
785,"Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth."
785,"Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies."
785,"(Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.)"
785,"Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own."
786,"It's a time of regrowth in the old urban center, and the hippest and best beer crafters have gathered both hops and hopes in building the best brewery in the city."
786,"It won't be an easy task, as players compete for precious resources such as malt, yeast, fruit and spices in the local markets, all while managing and optimizing their growing bottling empires."
786,"In Brew Crafters, players assume management of a local craft brewery, working hard to manage resources, use their workers wisely, and develop their brewing line to create the best local brews."
786,"Brew Crafters honors the tradition of classic Eurogames such as Agricola and Puerto Rico, but at its heart beats a unique brewery processing system that must be constantly improved, monitored, and manned in order to keep the beloved beverages rolling off the line."
786,"Each brewery has access to a variety of equipment upgrades, local farms, markets, and a plethora of specialty workers, ensuring a high level of replayability and strategic avenues."
786,"In addition, each player is studiously working to be first to develop several rotating gold-label specialty recipes that will earn them extra points and prestige at the end of year three when the best local brewer will be honored."
787,"A dexterity dice game consisting of four sets of colored dice one either slides, rolls, or flicks down a stepped surface."
787,Usually one slides the die for better accuracy.
787,"After each person has slid their 4 dice, points are scored."
787,"You score the die roll times a multiplier of either 1×, 2×, 3×, or 4× depending on which area of the board the die is on."
787,(Dice which land in the 0× region are immediately removed from play.)
787,High scoring rolls are targets for opponents.

790,"In an abandoned warehouse a gangster band is splitting its loot, but they can't agree on the split!"
790,It's time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone.
790,The richest surviving gangster wins the game!
790,Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies.
790,The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.
790,"Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play."
790,"First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs."
790,"Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a ""Bang!"""
790,"or a ""Click!"
790,"Click!"""
790,card from their hand.
790,"The Boss counts to three, and on ""Three"" each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction."
790,"After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round."
790,"Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a ""Bang!"""
790,takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot.
790,"Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table — money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a ""Bang!"""
790,card to your hand) — until everything has been claimed.
790,"After eight rounds, the game ends."
790,"Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected."
790,Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!
791,"Catacombs is an award-winning, cooperative board game set in the fantasy world of Cimathue, and you need skill and dexterity to master this fast-paced game."
791,One player (the Overseer) marshals an army of monsters while the others choose from six brave heroes who embark on a quest to save the town of Stormtryne from the threat lurking in the catacombs below.
791,"As the heroes explore, they must use their abilities, buy items, and recruit allies to help them defeat the monsters before facing the powerful Catacomb Lord, thereby saving the town."
791,"In more detail, in Catacombs players flick wooden discs that represent the monsters and heroes."
791,"Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, while missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects."
791,"When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb."
791,Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters.
791,The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game.
791,"Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated."
791,"This third edition of Catacombs has all-new artwork compared to the earlier editions, but more importantly the keywords from the first two editions has been replace with iconography, the terminology has changed, and the third edition has new shot types, new card effects, and a different set of components (many of which have changed statistics) as well as wall pieces not present in earlier editions."
792,Warhammer Underworlds is a tactical arena combat game.
792,"This is a system designed for balanced, small-scale tactical games that can be played quickly and easily by anyone, but which even experienced players will find challenging to master."
792,"The game rules are designed with competitive play in mind; matches can be played in under 45 minutes, on a smaller surface than our larger-scale games, and will be ideal for club or tournament play."
792,"And not only that, we’ll be fully supporting an organized play system for this game, right from day one."
792,"The forces you can use in this game will be drawn from races across the Mortal Realms, including some for factions that have not received any new miniatures since we first ventured into the Age of Sigmar."
792,"Each of these sets will be composed of a small band of easy-to-assemble, push-fit miniatures in the style of our single-pose heroes to represent a specific band of warriors from that faction."
792,"These are provided in coloured plastic, and clip together, so you can quite literally be playing with them within minutes of opening the box with no glue or paint needed!"
792,"(Though they do look great painted, and your dice will roll better – probably.)"
792,"The game is played using unique dice and card decks, and these will, to an extent, be unique to each faction."
792,Both decks of cards used in the game are fully customisable – meaning you can choose to create all manner of combinations of overlapping abilities to use and objectives to achieve.
792,This can be a really rewarding part of the game – and means that even the same faction can be played in wildly different ways.
792,"We’re expecting to see all sorts of combinations tried out at game stores, clubs and in tournaments."

793,Santiago is about cultivating and watering fields.
793,"To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round."
793,"The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be."
793,Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round.
793,"The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money."
793,"The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though."
793,"At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like."
793,"Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground."
793,"At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts."
793,Each plantation is counted according to type – the bigger the better.
793,"But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players."
794,For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands.
794,Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic.
794,The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.
794,Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion.
794,Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks.
794,"Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards."
794,"In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon."
794,A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters.
794,"Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy."
794,"Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon."
794,From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out.
794,Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards.
794,If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster.
794,Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player.
794,If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck.
794,This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards.
794,"In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions."
794,The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it.
794,The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.
794,The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.
794,"Integrates with

Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin
Thunderstone: Dragonspire
Thunderstone: Starter Set"
795,Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game.
795,"Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game."
795,"Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins."
795,"As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases."
795,"Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items."
795,"As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made."
795,What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game.
795,It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size.
795,The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box.
795,"The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand."
795,"The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image."
795,"With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value."
795,The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five).
795,"More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference."
795,"This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age."
795,"Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price."
795,"For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013."
795,"From the publisher's website:
Dare to discover Forbidden Island!"
795,Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise.
795,"Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step!"
795,Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!
796,"The woods are old-growth, dappled with sunlight."
796,Delicious mushrooms beckon from every grove and hollow.
796,"Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector."
796,Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day.
796,Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza.
796,"If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you sauté them in butter."
796,Feeling mercantile?
796,Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.
796,"Morels, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight."
796,Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking.
796,"Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played."
796,Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms – sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough – earns points toward winning the game.
796,"With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn."
796,"Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time."
796,"The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead."
797,"Cerebria is a dynamic, team-based, objective-driven area control game, where players play as Spirits, powerful entities representing Bliss or Gloom."
797,"These opposing forces - the two sides of human nature - struggle to control and shape the Inside World, the metaphorical representation of an evolving personality."
797,Cerebria introduces a unique theme and numerous innovative mechanisms.
797,"The game is centered around the player-controlled Spirits, and the Emotion cards controlling Cerebria’s areas, each with their own stats and abilities."
797,The Spirits can perform up to three actions on their turn.
797,"These include moving between Cerebria’s Realms and Frontiers, using the specific powers of the Realms, invoking and upgrading Emotion cards, removing opposing Emotions, and building Fortresses to consolidate their influence on certain areas."
797,"The Actions cost Willpower, gained primarily by absorbing from the Origin’s Spheres in the middle of the board."
797,"Both Bliss and Gloom also have a rare shared team resource, Ambition, enabling them to use the game’s most powerful effects."
797,"The teams can score points either by accomplishing publicly known minor objectives (the Intentions), or completing their major objectives (the Aspirations), which change dynamically during the course of the game."
797,"Scoring Aspirations allows players to add Bliss and Gloom Fragments to the Identity, built in the middle of the board."
797,"These are key moments in the game: Cerebria’s state is in constant flux, but the Fragments are permanent imprints of a game state during the scoring events."
797,"The game is won by the side with more influence over the finished Identity, thus becoming the dominant force in Cerebria."
798,Players are attempting to score the most points by building up influence in the districts of Venice via their aristocrats.
798,"The game uses a card distribution mechanic whereby (in the case of a four-player game) two players draw cards and divide them up into two piles each, the other two players pick one group and the remaining groups go to the players who formed the groups."
798,"The action cards allow players to place and remove aristocrats, erect and move bridges, and score individual regions."
798,The entire game lasts three Passages and each Passage may contain several turns.
798,"62 Action cards:
   30 District (5 for each district)
    6 Bridge
   12 Transfer
   10 Doge
    4 Banishment
28 Limit cards:
   8 X ""1""
   10 X ""2""
   10 X ""3""

799,(Twenty dice in five colors are rolled at the beginning of each round.)
799,You place it on your player board (your city) and perform one of the possible actions.
799,"The color of the chosen die determines the action, and the number on the die is a discount on the cost of the action."
799,"During a round, each player can perform up to four actions."
799,"At the end of the round, if the sum of a player's chosen dice is equal or lower than 13, he can obtain a reward."
799,"The dice mechanism is easy and innovative and gives players a simple, but challenging choice."

800,The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).
800,"Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins."
800,"In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards — one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc."
800,"— then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round."
800,"If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit."
800,"The dealer cannot choose ""no trump""."
800,On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump.
800,Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.
800,The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules.
800,"If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible."
800,"If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led."
800,"If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want."
800,"However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led."
800,"After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick."
800,"If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick."
800,"If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick."
800,"If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins."
800,"After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round."
800,"If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken."
800,"If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted."
800,"A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round."
801,"In The Palaces of Carrara, players want to buy the marble from this famous region of Italy as cheaply as possible – but any reduction in price will benefit opponents as well."
801,Maybe you'll find it profitable to instead invest in the buildings created from this marble?
801,Maybe it'll be more worthwhile to grab the expensive raw material when bigger buildings in town turn out to be not so lucrative?
801,The game includes two levels of play: beginner and advanced.
801,"Co-designer Wolfgang Kramer says, ""To understand the game, it's important that players play the beginner version to learn the game mechanisms and how they mesh together."""

802,"First, though, you need to construct that building."
802,"Players each start the game with five roof cards, and they take turns adding walls and roofs to a single building."
802,"On a turn, you first place walls on the highest floor, then you choose a roof card in your hand and place it on the wall."
802,Each roof card bears markings that indicate where the next player must place walls on the card.
802,"In addition, some roof cards force a player to perform special actions, such as placing a second roof, changing the direction of play, or moving Super Rhino to a new location on the tower."
802,Keep your hands steady!
802,The first player to build all of their roof cards wins the game.
802,"Alternatively, if the building collapses, the player who caused the collapse automatically loses, and the player with the fewest roof cards in hand wins."

803,"from GMT website:
Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is a game of grand strategy for two to six players based on the military, political and religious conflicts within Europe during the reigns of Elizabeth I of England and Philip II of Spain."
803,Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day.
803,"Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire."
803,But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies.
803,The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked.
803,Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire.
803,And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands.
803,Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies?
803,"Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion."
803,And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.
803,"The six powers in Virgin Queen are:

 Ottoman
 Spain
 England
 France
 Holy Roman Empire
 Protestants (Dutch & Huguenots)


Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556)."
803,Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged.
803,"New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:

 Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle."
803,"World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe."
803,Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.
803,"Weddings: Here I Stand’s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist."
803,Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal.
803,"Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?"
803,"Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm."
803,"Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?"
803,"Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period – a time of espionage and spymasters."
803,"In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion."
803,"There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:

 Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto."
803,Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.
803,"Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players."
803,Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.
803,"Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play."
803,Once again supports from 4 to 6 players.
804,"Hannibal & Hamilcar: Rome vs Carthage is a 20th anniversary edition of the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, an asymmetrical card-driven game for 2 players set in the time of the epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage."
804,"It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from the classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve political dominance."
804,Hannibal was designed by the world-renowned Mark Simonitch.
804,This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants.
804,"Certain game mechanics have been streamlined, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic."
804,"Hannibal has won numerous awards (including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award), and is currently ranked 11th in BoardGameGeek.com’s Wargame rankings."
804,The original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz.
804,"The development team at PHALANX has given the original game a careful, meticulous update."
804,It is now easier and faster to play.
804,It has received new artwork.
804,The original game has been further enriched by the addition of two new expansions: Sun of Macedon and Price of Failure.
804,"These expansions are not Kickstarter exclusives, so they will be available as a separate products."
804,"This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants as well as new graphics, miniatures, new custom dice, extra cards, and a new double-sided mounted board (with the Hannibal map on one side and the Hamilcar map on the other)."
804,"Hamilcar, set during the First Punic War, is a companion game sharing components and using similar mechanics."
804,It introduces a naval system and naval battles.
804,Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea in a conflict that will be described as a war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world’s naval power.
804,"Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula."
804,"In both games players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events."
804,"When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner."
804,Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.
805,"Akrotiri places you in the role of an explorer in Classical Greek times, combing the then-uncharted Aegean sea for lost Minoan temples that have long ago fallen into ruin."
805,"You've not only heard of these temples hidden around the island of Thera, but you actually have access to the secret maps that tell you of their hidden locations!"
805,Two mountains to the north?
805,A volcano to the west?
805,This *must* be the spot...
805,But running an expedition can be costly.
805,"In order to fund your voyages into the unknown and excavate the ancient temples, you will have to first ship resources found on surrounding islands back to the resource-poor island of Thera."
805,"In Akrotiri — which combines tile placement, hand management, and pick-up and delivery — players place land tiles in order to make the board match the maps that they have in hand."
805,"Players excavate temples; the ones that are harder to find and the ones further away from Thera are worth more towards victory, but the secret goal cards keep everyone guessing who the victor is until the end!"
805,May the gods forever bless you with favorable winds!
806,"In Roll Through the Ages, players roll dice to obtain commodities and workers to build up their civilizations."
806,Dice can be rerolled twice unless they come up as a hazard.
806,Players use their workers to build infrastructure to support additional works or to build monuments that are worth points.
806,"At the same time, commodities are gathered that allow your civilization to develop."
806,"Once all monuments or five developments are achieved by a player, the game ends at the end of the round, points are counted, and a victor is declared."

811,"Description from the publisher:
Legendary explorer Percy Fawcett marched deep into the Amazon in search of El Dorado."
811,He was never seen again.
811,"Your team has gone in search of him, but now you hope to escape the jungle with the greatest treasure of all: your life."

811,Choose your path carefully to ensure you're ready for the pitfalls that may occur.
811,"Play solo or cooperatively to survive the expedition, or play in teams to see which group can escape the jungle first."
811,"Errata:
In the 'head-to-head' rules, the diagram shows more cards than can legally be played."
811,The rules-as-written are correct.
812,"Revered for its healing techniques, the town of Yharnam is rapidly degrading as a plague that turns people into beasts spreads uncontrollably."
812,"As a Hunter, it falls to you to quell this growing threat."
812,"You will have to fight through beasts, monsters, and townsfolk alike to survive the night and discover the source of this madness."
812,"In the campaign-based action-adventure Bloodborne: The Board Game, players take on the role of Hunters, working together against the game to uncover the mysteries hidden within the city of Yharnam and beyond."

814,Letter Jam is a 2-6 player cooperative word game where players assist each other in composing meaningful words from letters around the table.
814,The trick is holding the letter card so that it’s only visible to other players and not to you.
814,"At the start of the game, each player receives a set of face-down letter cards that can be arranged to form an existing word."
814,"The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other."
814,"Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins."
814,The game is played in turns.
814,"Each turn, players simultaneously search other players’ letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up)."

814,"They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents."

814,"If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter."
814,"At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word."
814,All players then reveal their cards to see if they were successful or not.
814,"The more players who have an existing word in front of them, the bigger their common success."

815,"The Legendary universe gets flipped upside down in Legendary: Villains – Marvel Deck Building Game, and you can now play as villains trying to take out the heroes protecting the city!"
815,The goal of the game remains roughly the same as in the first Legendary game as players can work both with and against other players to overcome obstacles that the game throws at them.

816,"In Genoa (originally published as The Traders of Genoa), players take the part of Renaissance traders, moving about the city acquiring goods and filling orders for goods."

817,"Bridge is a standard deck, trick taking card game that pits two partnerships against each other."
817,"The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract."
817,The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid.
817,"After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership."
817,"One hand is played normally while the other (the ""dummy hand"") is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control."
817,The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.
817,"The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name ""Bridge"" is the most common usage."
817,Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist.
817,The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and his or her partner's hand to become dummy.
817,"Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership."
817,"Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring."
817,"The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results."
817,This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.
818,Formula Dé is a fast-paced racing game in which the cars' top speeds are limited by having to end a certain number of turns in each curve of the racetrack.
818,"This can be tricky, because although players can regulate their speeds by choosing which gear to be in and each gear allows a certain range of movement, the exact amount is determined randomly."
818,Great fun for a big group.
818,"The base game comes with:

 One set of dice (special d30, d20, d12, d8, d6, d4 and a normal black d20)
 Ten plastic cars (with interchangeable rear spoilers)

819,Blue Lagoon is an area control and set collection game in which players manage a group of settlers spreading out over the islands of a newly discovered archipelago.
819,The game is played over two phases (the exploration phase followed by the settlement phase).
819,"Over the course of both phases, you will expand your presence on the board by adding one new token each turn (either a settler or a village token)."
819,The goal is to collect the resources scattered over the map by placing your tokens on top of them.
819,"In the first phase, you can place a new token anywhere you like, as long as it is touching either the lagoon OR one of your previously played tokens."
819,"In the second phase, the board is cleared, except for the villages, and now you can only expand  from the villages you played in the first phase!"
819,"At the end of both phases, players score points for the sets of resources they collected."
819,Most points wins.
820,"Pictomania is a drawing game in which everyone is both drawing and guessing at the same time, giving a chance for those who excel only at one or the other skill to crush the dreams of other players."
820,"Pictomania lasts five rounds, and at the start of each round, you set up six randomly drawn cards on card racks visible to all players."
820,"Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side."
820,"In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw."
820,Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.
820,Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw.
820,"While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack."
820,"Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind."
820,"Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too."
820,Once you have finished drawing and guessing – and you're not required to do either – take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions.
820,"Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends."
820,"One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made."
820,"Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table."
820,"Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep – the player who made the worst guesses."
820,"If a single player has more cards in the center of the table than anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points."
820,"What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it."
820,"You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep ""bonus"" and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative."
820,"Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round."
820,The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.
821,A board game for two to five players with elements of area control and simultaneous action selection.
821,"During the game, the players take different roles and travel from city to city in India."
821,Their architects build palaces and houses for the Maharadja.
821,"Of course, building a palace is expensive."
821,"Therefore, it is important to earn enough money in the cities."
821,The first player who builds seven palaces is the winner.
821,"Players choose their actions simultaneously, but reveal and resolve them in turn."
821,"Actions include generating money, building houses or palaces, manipulating the Maharaja's movements, and choosing new architects (each architect has a unique power, but the more powerful ones come further down the turn order)."
821,"At the end of each round, the Maharaja scores the city he is currently in based on the number of buildings, and players receive money accordingly."
821,He then moves to a new city.
821,"Besides the basic game, the rules booklet contains two advanced versions for players who seek even more depth in their game play."

822,Spot a clue in the image.
822,See a hidden link between several pieces of information.
822,Use your instinct as much as your logic.
822,"In the beginning, you'll explore the Dreamworld, trying to find out what this is all about and who you are – and you are there for a specific reason, but, at first, you can't remember too much."
822,You'll have to restore your memories from scattered pieces.
822,"The rules are pretty straightforward at the beginning, but they will grow more and more complex during the campaign."
822,"New rules open new possibilities and, sometimes, may turn everything upside down."
822,"Deckbuilding in Etherfields applies to almost every deck in the game, not only the players' ones."
822,"If you want to know more, enter the Dreamworld."
822,"It may be dark here and there, but it certainly isn't gray."
822,"Then, look around and ask yourself: what if we all live in a vast, shared dream?"

827,"Mah-Jongg (Chinese 麻將/麻将 Májiàng [game of the] sparrow) is a traditional Chinese game using illustrated tiles, with game play similarities to rummy."
827,"It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing."
827,"The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the ""Ace"" of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think ""White dragon in a snowstorm""), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north)."

827,"players ""Mah Jongg""?"

831,Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.
831,Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.
831,Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty.
831,Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage - unless you are falling into water.
831,Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.
831,"You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card."
831,Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds.
831,"When the number of wounds equals the unit's life value, it is killed and removed from the board."
831,The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.
831,"It's possible to bring a ""pre-fab"" army to the battle in order to save time."
831,"The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options."
831,"There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online."
831,"From the publisher:
For years the Marro have been summoned to Valhalla to expand the will of Utgar at all costs."
831,But rumors are spreading that within the uncharted jungle there is an even greater menace waiting.
831,"A great Marro Hive, hidden deep within in the jungle swamps and treacherous rock is continuously spawning new savage predators."
831,"These creatures, said to be venomous Marro, perhaps even Hivelords, will emerge from their colony and contaminate the world."
831,Includes 24 detailed miniature figures and 75 interlocking terrain pieces.
831,This new Master Set includes everything you need to start your own adventures in the Heroscape world of Valhalla!
831,"There are 2 new Terrain Types: Swamp & Swamp Water, as well as more Grass, Sand, Rock, and Water tiles to add to your existing Heroscape battlefields."
831,"Also included in the set are 7 Unique Heroes, and 3 Common Marro Squads."
831,"However, the big news is the inclusion of the Marro Hive."
831,The Hive has special powers directly relating to Common Marro Squad figures.
832,Palm Island is a portable game that you can take with you anywhere.
832,"Sitting, standing, waiting, riding, flying, relaxing, alone, or together you can play Palm Island no table required."
832,Using a deck transforming mechanic a player uses just 17 cards over 8 rounds to shape their island and overcome its unique challenges.
832,Store resources to pay for upgrades and upgrade buildings to access new abilities.
832,Each decision you make will alter your village from round to round.
832,At the end of 8 rounds calculate your victory points.
832,PLAY SOLO working to gain achievements and unlock new abilities to help your village reach even greater heights.
832,PLAY COOPERATIVELY by working together to successfully prepare your village before natural disasters strike.
832,"PLAY COMPETITIVELY by racing to purchase bonuses, or in casual mode by meeting specific criteria before your opponent."
832,Add villagers to any game mode that you may recruit to your village and use their abilities to score more points than your opponent.
832,"The game comes with 2 player decks, competitive cards, cooperative cards and solo feat cards."
832,Multiple games can be combined to add even more players.

833,The characters of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland are having a Parade!
833,All players are producers of this parade.
833,"Characters from Lewis Carroll's books such as Alice, The White Rabbit, and The Hatter are steadily invited to join this weird procession."
833,"On your turn, you play a card (from your hand of five) to the end of the parade."
833,"Unfortunately, that card might cause other cards to walk off the parade."
833,These cards count as negative points in the end.
833,The length of the parade line is important.
833,"If the number of the card you just played is less than the line length, you may receive the excess cards (counting from last played to the first of the line)."
833,"But you don't take all the relevant cards, only the cards that meet one of these requirements:
1. the color is the same as color of the card just played, or 
2. the number is the same or lower than the card just played
The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted or when one player has collected all six colors in their point piles."
833,Then everyone plays one last card.
833,"From the four cards remaining in their hand, players choose two cards to add to his or her point piles."
833,The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner.
833,"Scoring:
Normally, negative points are same the number on the card."
833,"But if you have the most cards in a certain color, each of your cards of that color counts as only 1 negative point!"
833,"Thus, play your cards well!"
834,"Introduction
The ancient Galactic Realm, ruled from the Core Worlds of the galaxy, is waning."
834,"Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations."
834,But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly.
834,"The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics."
834,They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces.
834,"Then, when the time is right, they must strike at the galactic core itself, claiming the most exalted planets for themselves."
834,The barbarian kingdom that achieves these goals will carve out the greatest empire in the galaxy.
834,"Object of the Game
Each player controls a barbarian Star Empire represented by many cards."
834,"Throughout the game, players will invade Worlds and draft new Units and Tactics into their Empires."
834,Each card lists its Empire Points in the upper right corner.
834,The player whose Empire contains the most Empire Points at the end of the game is the winner!
834,"Game Terms and Game Play Mechanisms
Core Worlds is a deck-building card game for 2-5 players."
834,"The following are the central concepts of Core Worlds:
• Central Zone: Throughout the game, new cards are drawn from the five Galactic Decks and placed face up in the Central Zone, the game's common play area."
834,"These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade."
834,• Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck.
834,"A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau)."
834,• Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack.
834,A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded.
834,Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.
834,• Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault.
834,A World's Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded.
834,Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.
834,"• Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions."
834,A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.
834,"• Warzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed."
834,"Players also deploy Units from their hands face up into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds."
835,"The harvest is in, and the artisans are hard at work preparing for the upcoming festival."
835,Decorate the palace lake with floating lanterns and compete to become the most honored artisan when the festival begins.
835,"In Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, players have a hand of tiles depicting various color arrangements of floating lanterns, as well as an inventory of individual lantern cards of specific colors."
835,"When you place a tile, all players (you and your opponents) receive a lantern card corresponding to the color on the side of the tile facing them."
835,"Place carefully to earn cards and other bonuses for yourself, while also looking to deny your opponents."
835,"Players gain honor by dedicating sets of lantern cards — three pairs, for example, or all seven colors — and the player with the most honor at the end of the game wins."
836,"Players struggle for influence over regions of Europe by placing two different type of control markers, Monasteries and Advisors."
836,"Monasteries are the basic placement, with the goal of securing a majority in a region or chain of monasteries or even decent points from second place."
836,The placement of the Advisors is more restricted as the total number of Advisors in a region is limited by the majority player's number of monasteries.
836,The game is played in two rounds and is very fast paced.

837,The battle ignites in the Mountains of Sorrow!
837,"The Mountains of Sorrow are aptly named, for they have been the site of the unending clash between Goblin and Dwarf."
837,The Cave Goblins seek merely to throw themselves upon any foe with the will to fight.
837,"The Guild Dwarves sit in their mountain halls, jealously guarding their ancient riches."
837,"But with the discovery of the Summoning Stones comes a new kind of combat, and now these two great races will help set off the War for Itharia."
837,"Summoner Wars: Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins gives players everything they need to join the War for Itharia, as either of these great races."

837,"This Summoner Wars Starter Set provides two complete Faction decks, as well as all the materials needed to play games of Summoner Wars."
838,"Wasteland Express Delivery Service is the depraved brainchild of a superstar team of acclaimed game designers: Jon Gilmour (Dead of Winter), Matt Riddle (Fleet, Morocco), and Ben Pinchback (Fleet, Morocco), brought to technicolor life by award-winning comic artist Riccardo Burchielli (DMZ, Batman Black and White) to create the perfect marriage of emergent thematic gameplay and balanced strategy."
838,Take on the role of the half-insane drivers for the last delivery company left of earth: the Wasteland Express Delivery Service.
838,"In order to scratch out a living in this deranged universe, drivers will deliver goods and guns between the handful of settlements pockmarked throughout the hellscape that you call home and take on missions from the handful of factions still trying to hold onto the last dregs of civilization."
838,"Course, none of this is easy."
838,Inhabiting the post-apocalyptic wasteland are unhinged characters set on unleashing mayhem at every turn.
838,"If you want to survive, you'll have to battle through the psycho raiders who occupy the void between cities."
838,"Maybe the world can be saved, maybe you can bring humanity back from the brink."
838,Band the world back together to fight back against the void.
838,"Then again, what the f*&% do you care?"
838,You're here to get paid and live another day free.

840,"From Wizards of the Coast website:
A cooperative game of adventure for 1-5 players set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons."
840,"A heavy shadow falls across the land, cast by a dark spire that belches smoke and oozes fiery lava."
840,"A cave mouth leads to a maze of tunnels and chambers, and deep within this monster-infested labyrinth lurks the most terrifying creature of all: a red dragon!"
840,"Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative game play."
840,"Each player selects a hero; a rogue, thief, warrior, cleric, or wizard."
840,"On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters."
840,"When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added."
840,"Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play."
840,"Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest."

842,Thunder Alley is a stock car racing game for 2–7 players with the feel and flexibility of a card-driven simulation.
842,"Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game."
842,"Players control not one car, but a team of 3–6 cars."
842,"Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team."
842,"Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in."
842,"The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:

Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack."
842,Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.
842,Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.
842,"Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid."
842,"The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone."
842,Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.
842,Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops.
842,"Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game."
842,"If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits."
842,Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car.
842,"What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions."
842,"Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game."
842,Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?
842,Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel.
842,Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other.
842,The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.
842,Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.
842,An unusual bonus for Thunder Alley is the very playable and exciting two-player version with six cars on a side.
843,"In JAWS, one player takes on the role of the killer shark off Amity Island, while the other 1-3 players take on the roles of Brody, Hooper and Quint to hunt the shark."
843,Character and event cards define player abilities and create game actions for humans and the shark.
843,"Gameplay is divided into two acts — Amity Island and The Orca — played on a double-sided board to replicate the film's story:

In the Amity Island phase, the shark menaces swimmers and avoids capture."
843,Other players attempt to pinpoint the shark's location and save swimmers from shark attacks.
843,"In the Orca phase, played on the reverse side of the game board, Brody, Hooper and Quint are aboard the sinking ship engaging in a climactic battle against the shark, while using additional action and strategy cards to defend the Orca from targeted shark attacks."
843,"If humans kill the shark, they win; if the shark attack on the Orca succeeds, the great white shark wins."
844,Tragedy Looper is a scenario-based deduction game for two to four players: one mastermind and one to three protagonists.
844,The game consists of four location boards and a number of character cards.
844,"Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide)."
844,"Each ""day"" (turn), players and the mastermind play three face-down cards onto the characters, then reveal them to move the characters around or affect their paranoia or goodwill stats."
844,"At the end of each day (turn), if the scenario has a tragedy set for that day, it happens if the conditions are met, i.e., certain characters have certain stats or are in a certain location together (or not together) with others."
844,"As tragedies happen, players loop back in time, restarting the scenario from the beginning and trying to deduce who the culprit was and why the tragedy occurred."
844,"The players win if they manage to maintain status quo — that is, if no tragedies occur to the key individuals — for a set number of days, within a set number of loops."
844,"If not, the mastermind wins."
844,Tragedy Looper was originally released in Japan as 惨劇RoopeR in 2011; the first english version of the game was released in 2014.
845,"""Britannia"" is a historical Strategic board-wargame that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales."
845,"The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066."
845,"Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others."
845,"The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain’s history in important ways, creating countless interesting “what if?” scenarios."
845,What if Boudicca’s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful?
845,What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries?
845,What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?
845,"In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom."
846,"Samael is dead, but a storm is still raging across Vigil."
846,Ascension: Storm of Souls takes players into the chaos following the Fallen One's demise.
846,"As Samael's monsters run wild and his minions conspire, the world is being slowly overtaken with souls that should have moved on."
846,Are you ready for the new challenges that Vigil's future holds?
846,Ascension: Storm of Souls is the first full-sized expansion for the hit deck-building game from Gary Games.
846,"The 200-card set features tons of new cards and mechanisms, in addition to a new Event card type."
846,This is a complete game for 1-4 players that's playable on its own or in combination with other Ascension games.
846,Combine this with other Ascension games to play with up to six players!
847,"In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality."
847,"Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within."
847,"The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H."
847,(Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors).
847,"Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes."
847,"The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them)."
847,"The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game."
847,Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team.
847,Bruisers are excellent melee fighters.
847,Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance.
847,And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city.
847,Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others.
847,Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH’s victory.
847,Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game.
847,"It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn’t be capable of normally."
847,"Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences."
847,"The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin!"
847,"These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions."
847,"Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin."
847,"Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect."
847,"For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board."
847,"Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission."
847,"The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type."
847,"These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives."
847,"For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing."
847,There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others.
847,"Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious."
847,"There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain."
847,"Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique."
847,"The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets."
847,"As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it’s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them."
847,"For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike."
847,"What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game."
847,"As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying."
847,"Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!"
847,Heroes will die.
847,"Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls."
847,"The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity."

848,Martin Wallace's streamlined redesign of Brass: Lancashire.
848,Players are tycoons in the early days of the Industrial Revolution; a time when traditional craftsman were being rapidly replaced with steam-powered machines.
848,"Players invest in the production of raw materials, the manufacture of goods, and the transportation networks needed to connect them to their markets."
848,"Like Brass, the strategic space is vast, and player decisions are limited by cards."
848,"In Age of Industry, however, cards are color-coded to regions rather than specific cities, allowing the players to be more flexible with their plans, while at the same time continuing to limit the decisions available."
848,The color-coded region cards will also support expansion maps.
848,"In addition, the original Brass rules were simplified by eliminating the canal period; there is only one period, the railway era."
848,"There is also a new, non-specific industry, which will change with each map."
848,"According to Wallace, ""You can now play something with the depth of Brass, but in half the time."
848,"The game will have a double-sided map, with Germany on one side and southern New England on the other."""
849,Make your fate!
849,"Inspired by character-driven fantasy storytelling, Call to Adventure challenges 1-4 players to create the hero with the greatest destiny by acquiring traits, facing challenges, and overcoming adversaries."
849,"Call to Adventure features a unique ""rune rolling"" system for resolving challenges, a point-based system that encourages storytelling, and over 150 unique cards."
849,"Players begin each game with an origin card that provides their backstory as well as two ""starter"" abilities."
849,Each round they may either acquire trait cards from the board or face a challenge.
849,Challenges each have two possible paths a player can choose from.
849,"For example, players who encounter the Thieves' Guild may choose to train as a spy, or train as a killer."
849,Each challenge has a difficulty that must be overcome by rolling successes on carved runes.
849,"The more a player has of the abilities required to overcome the challenge, the more runes they will be able to cast."
849,"Failed challenges lead players to acquire experience points that may be spent to ""push"" through tougher challenges."
849,"But beware, while some negative experiences will help your hero grow, too many tragedies set them on a dark path."
849,"As players' heroes grow in ability and experience, they move on to harder challenges, eventually facing deadly adversaries and acquiring more and more destiny points."
849,The player whose hero has the highest destiny score wins the game.
850,Paris is a two-player board game by José Antonio Abascal infused with Parisian aesthetics by the boardgame’s artist Oriol Hernández.
850,"The game is set in late 19th century Paris during the 1889 “Exposition Universelle,” or world’s fair, when public electricity was a hot topic."
850,"Electricity spread throughout the city, creating today’s beautiful nocturnal Parisian streets and coining Paris’s nickname “La Cité de la Lumiére”, the city of lights."
850,The most well-lit buildings are admired more highly by passers-by.
850,"In the first phase, players can either place tiles or grow their reserve of buildings."
850,"The cobblestone tiles are divided into 4 random spaces (their color, their opponents’ color, a streetlight or a mixed-color space where either player can build)."
850,"Then, in the second phase, players build on top of their color or the mixed spaces, in effort to position their buildings as close to as many streetlights as possible."
850,More streetlights solicit more adoration and points.
850,The player with the best lit buildings steals the hearts of Parisian pedestrians and wins the game.

851,A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom.
851,"Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze."
851,"Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong."
851,There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins.
851,Which one will you choose?
851,"Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk — and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons."
851,"The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out..."
851,"In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure."

882,"In a delicate balance of resource management and area control, players must plan their building strategies while carefully managing their supply tracks to refine the right resources at the most opportune times."
882,Stay a step ahead of the competition and you could lead the West into the Golden Age.
882,The goal of Gold West is to accumulate the most victory points through clever management of your growing mining empire.
882,"There are five resources in the game: the metals Copper, Silver, and Gold are used to acquire victory points in a variety of ways, while Timber and Stone are building materials used to build camps and settlements on the board to collect more resources and influence the landscape."
882,Each hex contains either two or three resources.
882,"Gold generally earns players the most points, with silver and copper yielding slightly less."
882,"In addition, each terrain type scores points for the player with the most influence therein at the end of the game."
882,"Copper terrains are the most valuable, with Silver, Gold, and Forest Terrains earning slightly fewer points."
882,"When gaining new metals and materials, players place them in their ""supply track"", a mancala-style track in which you will manage your resources."
882,"You get points the further back in the track you place them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used."
882,"Shipping, investments, and Boomtown offices often reward players who fulfill them earlier, so it's a careful balance of risk and reward."

884,The low land is a rough area where hard-working folk make a living by the sweat of their brow.
884,"Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay."
884,But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm.
884,"The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape."
884,"In Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep."
884,"Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded."
884,"No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits."
884,"Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda?"
884,The choice is yours.
884,"Even without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit."
884,"To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm."
884,"To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them."
884,"Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes."
884,"You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit."
884,"While you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features."
884,"Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable."
884,"You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one."
884,Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit.
884,"While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it."
884,"Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own."
884,"On top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea."
884,"Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock."
884,"To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm."
884,"When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters."
884,Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone.
884,"The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces."
884,"If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared."
884,"If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game."
884,"While lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own."
884,"For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track."
884,"Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks."
884,"It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm."

886,"Each player must face the invaders, so this is not a cooperative game."
886,The resources to build structures and train troops are collected by influencing the advisers in the King's Council.
886,"Players place their influence dice on members of the Council, and each adviser awards different resources or allocate soldiers, victory points, and other advantages to the player who was able to influence that adviser for the current turn."
886,The player with the lowest influence dice sum is the first to choose where to spend their influence; this acts as a way of balancing poor dice rolling.
886,"Even with a very unlucky roll, a clever player can still come out from the Council with a good number of resources and/or soldiers."

894,"These islands are a major source of treasure, and players will battle for control of these islands."
894,"• Battle via a dynamic cube-tower: You can battle other players' ships or NPC merchant ships, and these battles are resolved via a new take on what a cube tower can be, with crew cards and ship powers increasing your chances of victory."

894,"Depending on luck and player choice, less or more new content may get added each game."

895,"Set in the Italian countryside, this game features various city-states vying for population."
895,"Each player is given two cities to start with, and is charged with expanding the different aspects of the cities to attract larger populations."
895,"Players build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy."
895,"Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories."
895,Superiority in one of these categories will cause population to shift from other nearby cities when the Voice of the People is decided at the end of each turn.
895,"At the end of six turns, the player with the most victory points, which are determined from well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and overall size of population, will be the winner."
895,"Note: The correct pronunciation is like ""Cheetah"", but with the accent on the last syllable: ""La Chee-TAH""."
896,It is 13th century Italy.
896,Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant.
896,"Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth."
896,"However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors."
896,Enter the Condottiere.
896,"As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men."
896,These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta.
896,The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.
896,The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy.
896,"To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures."
896,"However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid."
896,"Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province."
896,"However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing."
897,The Speicherstadt is an auction card game.
897,"Players compete for victory points, which come mainly from contracts (sets of resources) and special cards (like a collected set of 1-4 identical ""counting offices"", the port rewarding collected ship cards etc.)."
897,"The game is built on two core concepts:
1."
897,"Players bid for cards by building ""towers"" with their meeples over them."
897,"Each meeple in a tower increases the cost of a card - but only for players ""below"" it."
897,This is the main mechanic of the game - players must consider WHEN to bid (place their meeple) over a certain card and when to use their meeples to make others pay more.
897,"This is important, because a player can make only three bids during a round."
897,2.
897,Players are punished by negative points for not collecting firemen cards.
897,"Thus, ignoring security may cost a player a victory."
897,"By many players, the ""punishing"" mechanic is considered a trademark of the author - Stefan Feld."
897,"The deck is divided into four seasons - winter, spring, summer and autumn."
897,"In later seasons, more powerful cards appear, so players need to think ahead in managing their resources."
897,"---- Promotional blurb from the publisher ----
Hamburg around 1900 - the gate to the world."
897,Within the harbour there stretches a unique complex of storehouses: Speicherstadt.
897,"The network of canals and bridges houses a terminal for spices, coffee, tea and carpets from all over the world."
897,"As one of Hamburg´s wholesaler at the heyday of the Speicherstadt you acquire shiploads for the storehouses, not too expensive, of course, as you like to make a profit selling them."
897,Who makes the best deals within a year and supplies his clients with the right goods will be the winner of the game.
897,But beware!
897,Sudden fires cause heavy losses.
897,You might be advised to invest in fire protection early.
897,Playing Speicherstadt you will be thrilled by the simple and original mechanism of acquiring desired action cards.
898,"In battle, there are no equals."
898,"""They show extreme intelligence, even problem-solving intelligence."
898,"Especially the big one."""
898,"He has hunted many a dangerous predator, but against a pack of raptors, is Robert Muldoon the hunter or the hunted?"
898,"In Unmatched: Jurassic Park – InGen vs Raptors, these clever girls use their speed and agility to surround their prey, getting stronger when they attack together."
898,InGen's Game Warden and his Security Team lay traps to slow their opponent down and attack from range in a matchup 65 million years in the making.
898,Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players.
898,Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend.
898,"Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups."

899,Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is based on the first two movies of the Predator series.
899,"Taking on the roles of characters from the films, players take turns recruiting cards for their deck from a central selection in order to improve their deck and defeat Predator cards that are added to the central game board."
899,"In more detail, within the setting for each film you can play as the humans or as the Predators."
899,"As the humans, you play the co-op version of the game as in Legendary Encounters: Alien, recruiting, scanning and attacking the same way while trying to achieve objectives."
899,"When you play as the Predators, the game is player vs. player instead of co-op, with each player assuming the role of a Predator hunting for the most honor (VPs)."
899,Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is a standalone game in the Legendary Encounters series that is fully compatible with Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game.
899,"Specifically, you can use the Predator deck in Alien or the Alien deck in Predator."
899,"Similarly, Predator is also compatible with the Marvel superheroes version of Legendary but cannot be fully integrated."
900,"Description from the publisher:
A contested region of space accessible through a known wormhole has drawn the attention of powerful forces throughout the galaxy."
900,"Both the Federation and the Klingon Empire, who share a delicate alliance at this time, have recently built outposts in the region — but now news of grave troubles brewing in the region has prompted both the Klingons and the Federation to investigate immediately."
900,"Command your ship, recruit new crew members, earn experience points, and use your skills to confront the challenges of the Star Trek universe."
900,Explore and face a variety of challenges on a randomly built space map using the venture tile system first introduced in the award-winning game Mage Knight.
900,"Star Trek: Frontiers is designed for 1 to 4 players with multiple competitive, cooperative and solo scenarios."
900,Work together to defeat hostile ships or compete to explore and uncover hidden mysteries.
900,Players need to overcome obstacles to expand their knowledge and use their leadership as they adventure in order to be victorious in their exploration!
901,History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.
901,"The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C."
901,"Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history."
901,"Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out."
901,"At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board."
901,"Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch."
901,The game board is a stylized version of the globe.
901,The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.
901,Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events.
901,"These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation."
901,Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.
901,"There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few)."
901,Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.
901,One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.
901,"If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch."
901,Then the next player draws and makes his decision.
901,The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.
901,"Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by)."
901,"One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called."
901,Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.
901,The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.
901,If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).
901,A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).
901,If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.
901,Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.
901,To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.
901,"Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from."
901,In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.
901,If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.
901,Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.
901,"In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space."
901,At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.
901,"On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land."
901,"Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues."
901,Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).
901,"After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument."
901,Then scoring takes place.
901,"Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch."
901,One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).
901,Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area).
901,The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).
901,"These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example)."
901,Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.
901,"Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled."
901,After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.
901,"After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him."
901,These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.
901,"This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later."
901,Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).
901,"Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores."
901,The player with the highest score wins.

913,"Barges, freight and profits are what it's all about in Manila, a speculative contest for 3-5 players."
913,"Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm."
913,"While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice."
913,"There are four shipments that need to get to Manila - jade, ginseng, silk and nutmeg."
913,A round begins with an initial auction to become harbour master.
913,"If you win, you'll be allowed to buy a share of one of the shipments, choose which three shipments you'd like to take down river and how likely they are to make it to their destination in the harbour."
913,"If they make it to Manila, their share price will increase."
913,"The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of these shipments, with dice ultimately determining their fate."
913,How many of the three boats will make it and which ones?
913,Would you like to provide insurance against possible failed ships or perhaps you think pirates will snatch a chance to take control?

938,Time of Crisis is easy to learn and playable in about 2-3 hours.
938,"It incorporates popular game mechanisms such as deckbuilding and hand management, but also delivers a true light wargame experience."
938,"The historical flavor is strong, with many meaningful decisions and opportunities presented to players on the board."
938,This game finally fully closes the loop between deckbuilding card games and board games.
938,"Your cards dictate what actions are available to you on the board, and in turn, your position on the board directly determines how you can add or remove cards from your deck to make yourself stronger for future turns."
938,"Will you specialize in manipulating the Senate, wielding the power of the Legions, or being a man of the People?"
938,Or will you master a blend of all three?
938,"In a twist unlike most deckbuilding games, you have the privilege of selecting the cards that compose your hand each turn!"
938,"However, you still need to eventually work through  your entire deck before you can use your cards again, so deck management and timing is critical."
938,"All of the key elements of the era are present in Time of Crisis:  civil wars between competing generals and governors, Roman legions defending the frontiers against barbarian tribes, Senate favoritism, barracks emperors, even angry mobs, inflation, the Praetorian Guard, and the ability to carve off your own piece of the Roman Empire."
938,Can your dynasty arise as the new leaders of the Roman Empire before Diocletian emerges and brings peace once again?
939,"In Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, a two-player Living Card Game, you take the part of a warlord, leading your armies into battle against your opponent in a bid to claim glorious victory."
939,"Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire."
939,"You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war."
939,"Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau."
939,"Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions."
939,"At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war."
939,Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle.
939,"Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet."
939,"Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet."
939,Capturing planets is your ultimate goal.
939,Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium.
939,"Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth."
939,"Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets."
939,"These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game."
939,"Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths — and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory."
940,"In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand."
940,"Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it."
940,"Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy."
940,"Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment."
940,"Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation."
940,"If the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us."
940,"In the game CO₂, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants."
940,"The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy — and of course profiting from doing so."
940,"You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants."
940,"Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others."
940,"In CO₂, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal."
940,"These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant."
940,"CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game."
940,You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.
940,"Money, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation – and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course."
941,"In Wiz-War, wizards wage no-spells-barred magical duels deep in an underground labyrinth."
941,"This classic board game of magical mayhem for 2-4 players, created by Tom Jolly in 1983, pits players' wizards against each other in a stupendous struggle for magical mastery."
941,"Win by stealing other wizards' treasures and hauling them back to your base, or just score points by blasting the other wizards."
941,The last wizard standing always wins.
941,"Staying true to the spirit of the game that has entertained players for years, as well inspiring an entire genre of games, this 2011 edition of Wiz-War caters to the imagination and the funny bone."
941,"Casting an enriched array of spells, your wizards race through an underground maze, avoiding fireballs, werewolves, and psychic storms."
941,Subtle game enhancements by Kevin Wilson and Tom Jolly promote faster play and clarify card effects.

942,"In England in 1193, the county of Nottinghamshire suffers under the yoke of evil Prince John and his henchmen."
942,Can Robin Hood and his companions escape the sheriff's guards and complete their adventures successfully?
942,"In The Adventures of Robin Hood, players take on the role of Robin Hood and his companions, with the action taking place on a living game board with no set paths."
942,"The board changes over the course of each adventure, and the movement of the characters is handled via an innovative mechanism that uses different length wooden character pieces."
942,Various actions and secrets are integrated into the game levels and are revealed only in the course of the story.
942,"The game board ""remembers"" what players have already explored or found, and thanks to the special materials, the entire game can be set up and dismantled quickly."
942,"Instead of using cards as in the author's Legends of Andor, the game tells the story of Robin Hood in a high-quality hardcover book, and depending on the decisions the players make, the story changes..."
943,"Ticket to Ride: New York features the familiar gameplay from the Ticket to Ride game series — collect cards, claim routes, draw tickets — but on a scaled-down map of Manhattan that allows you to complete a game in no more than 15 minutes."
943,"Each player starts with a supply of 15 taxis, two transportation cards in hand, and one or two destination tickets that show locations in Manhattan (and Brooklyn)."
943,"On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up taxi, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them."
943,"Players take turns until someone has no more than two taxis in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game."
943,"Players then sum their points, scoring points for the routes that they've claimed during the game, the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their taxis), and the tourist attractions that they've reached with their taxis."
943,"You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!"
944,Railroad Ink Challenge is a quick-playing roll-and-write game for 1 to 4 players.
944,"Grab a board and a dry-erase marker, and get ready to reach networking nirvana!"
944,Roll the dice and draw the routes to connect the exits around your board.
944,"Expand your network with railways, highways and stations to collect points, but you will be penalized for any open connections, so plan carefully!"
944,"Railroad Ink Challenge has everything you love from the original Railroad Ink games and a lot more, with an all-new focus on player interaction thanks to in-game goals!"
944,"Only those who achieve them first get the reward, so you have to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing and try to complete the goals before they do!"
944,"A different set of goals is available each time, so no two games will be the same!"
944,"But wait, there's more!"
944,"Draw unprecedented, mind-bending route configurations thanks to the new dice!"
944,"Connect special structures to your network to trigger new effects: factories allow you to duplicate a die, villages give bonus points if they are close to a station, universities unlock extra special routes — use these effects wisely and you'll score big!"
944,"Railroad Ink Challenge comes in two versions, each one including one expansion with an additional dice set that adds new special rules to your games."

945,A Study in Emerald is a game for two to five players based on the award-winning short story of the same name by Neil Gaiman.
945,In this stylistic mash-up of Sherlock Holmes and H.P.
945,"Lovecraft, the worst has already happened and the world is now ruled by the Old Ones."
945,"However, a secret war is being fought to free mankind from their servitude."
945,"The game A Study in Emerald fleshes out this core idea by including historical figures from the late nineteenth century, most being persons involved in the anarchist movement of the time."
945,Deck-building forms the core of the game.
945,You use influence cubes to bid for the right to draft cards and take control of cities.
945,"Each player has a secret identity, either a Restorationist fighting against the creatures or a Loyalist attempting to defend the status quo."
945,Which side you are on determines what you score points for.
945,"An additional twist is that the performance of other players on the same side as you can stop you from winning if they are doing particularly badly, so you really want to know who is on which side."
945,"More specifically, when the game ends – and this can result from multiple causes, such as a marker on the War or Revolution track hitting 15 or the assassination of a Restorationist player agent – then the sides compare their scores; which side has the lowest score automatically loses, then the player with the highest score on the remaining team wins the game."
945,"The game takes around ninety minutes to play and is more complex than most, so more suitable for the experienced gamer."
946,"From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought and built together in nations."
946,"Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself."
946,"Nations must provide food as the population increases, build a productive economy, and amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!"
946,Nations: The Dice Game is a game for 1-4 players that takes 10-15 minutes per player and shares many concepts with the civilization-building game Nations while still offering its own challenges.
946,The game is played over four ages (four rounds).
946,"During each round, players take turns until all have passed."
946,"The available actions are:

 Buy a tile
 Build a wonder
 Reroll some or all your dice

Buildings and military provide dice."
946,Colonies and wonders provide resources and victory points.
946,Advisors provide rerolls.
946,"New tiles provide benefits immediately, so you can roll new dice at once."
946,"At the end of each round, War and Famine drawn at the start of the round is checked for each player, giving you victory points if you match or beat the values."
946,Books are accumulated and scored.
946,"Player order is checked, with high military strength going first in the next round."
946,"At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory points wins."
947,"Late Summer, 54 BC:  In a series of brilliant and brutal campaigns, Caesar has seized Gaul for Rome."

947,"Falling Sky: The Gallic Revolt Against Caesar, formerly Gallic War, takes 1 to 4 players into the military actions and complex politics of Roman-occupied but not-yet-conquered Gaul."
947,Caesar and his hard-hitting legions cannot be everywhere and will not triumph without powerful allies among local tribes.
947,"But each Gallic confederation has its own agenda and must keep its eyes not only on the Romans but also on Celtic, Belgic, and Germanic rivals."
947,"Players recruit forces, rally allies, husband resources for war, and balance dispersed action with the effectiveness and risk of concentrated battle."
947,"Leveraging GMT's popular COIN Series system to integrate historical events with wide-ranging strategic options across the game board, Falling Sky provides accessible and deep historical gaming of war, politics, and diplomacy."

948,"In Hey, That's My Fish!, players want to catch as many fish as possible with their waddle of penguins."
948,"Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them."
948,"The player then collects the hex from where the penguin started its movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which penguins can't cross on future turns."
948,"When a penguin can't move, it's removed from play with its owner claiming the tile on which it stands."
948,The player who collects the most fish wins.
949,"It's been twenty years since Victor Frankenstein died on a ship in the arctic, but his vengeful creature lives on, as does Robert Walton, the sea captain who vowed to kill the fiend before mercy stayed his hand."
949,"It's now 1819, and a sinister darkness descends upon the city of Paris."
949,"A mysterious benefactor of gigantic stature has emerged in the scientific community, never showing his face, claiming to possess the late Frankenstein's research."
949,"He sponsors a grand competition, offering an even grander prize: unlocking the mystery of mortality!"
949,"Renowned scientists from around the world come to take part: some drawn to solve this eternal riddle, others coerced against their will."
949,"But a certain captain comes as well, one deeply suspicious of the secretive patron, hoping to finally fulfill his vow."
949,"Abomination: The Heir of Frankenstein is a competitive game of strategic monster building for 2-4 players, inspired by Mary Shelley's classic novel of gothic horror."
949,"In the game, the creature demands your help to accomplish what his own creator would not: to bring to life an abomination like itself, a companion to end its miserable solitude."
949,"Through worker placement and careful management of decomposing resources, you'll gather materials from the cemeteries and morgues around the city, conduct valuable research at the Academy of Science, hire less-than-reputable associates, and toil away in your lab — all in an effort to assemble a new form of life and infuse it with a ""spark of being""."
949,"Do well, and the creature may reward you during one of its surprise visits; do poorly, and you may come to regret not putting forth more effort."
949,"Narrative elements come into play throughout the game, guided by your decisions, leading to potentially unsavory outcomes."
949,"The game ends when you succeed in bringing your creation to life or when the Captain kills the creature, whichever happens first."
949,"Then the player with the most points fulfills Frankenstein's dark legacy, becoming his heir, for good or ill...

950,Welcome Heroes!
950,"Many magnificent contestants have signed up for the tournament but only a handful will be chosen to join the Tidal Blades, the elite guards of our island realm."
950,"To succeed in the Tournament and be chosen as a Tidal Blade, you must compete in Challenges held in the 3 Arenas, rise to the top of the Champion’s Board, and protect the realm from the ever increasing threat of the Monsters from the mysterious Fold."
950,It has been fifteen years since the Great Battle; 15 years since the Arcanists from the Citadel of Time made their terrible choice and created the Fold; 15 years since the last assemblage of Tidal Blades.
950,"The Arcanists folded space and time to stop the onslaught of creatures from the depths, but now new Monsters have appeared, the hard-earned days of peace are coming to a close and the islands need protection."
950,"A tournament has been called, the Arenas are ready, the inhabitants of all the islands are gathering, and young heroes from across the realm are showing up to compete to be named a Tidal Blade: Hero of the Reef."
950,"In Tidal Blades: Heroes of the Reef, each player takes the role of a young hero competing to be named a Tidal Blade."
950,The tournament takes place over 5 Days and Nights.
950,"By gathering the needed resources, signing up to compete in Challenges and timing your arrival at different islands you can make the most of your Hero’s turns and rise in the ranks of the contestants."
950,Each day you will send your hero to take actions on the different Locations and to undertake Challenges.
950,Each action will gain you the resource or effect listed on the action space as well as the Location bonus.
950,"At the Arenas you may then attempt a Challenge that matches your Location, and at the Fold you may battle a monster."
950,"Completing Challenges and fighting monsters will advance your character in the four traits of Focus, Spirit, Resilience and Synergy."
950,"Each Tidal Blade will be judged at the end of the 5 rounds based on the Challenges they have completed, the level of each of their Traits, their standing on the Champions Board, and the monsters they have fought."
951,"Game description from the publisher:
Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy's crumbling imperial city."
951,"Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery."
951,"In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City."
951,"Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire."
951,"Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet)."
951,"Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions."
951,"Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then ""spent"" to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade."
951,Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game.
951,"From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage."
951,"While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below."
951,"Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities."
951,Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.
951,"Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable."
951,"When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results."
951,"Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader."
951,A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware!
951,"One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured."
951,"So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust."
951,"All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike."
951,"Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience."
952,Each player gets a cup with five poker dice and eight dollars.
952,"Each turn, a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location."
952,"In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die, which is kept apart from the others."
952,They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table.
952,Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.
952,"Now the locations are checked...
Nines: In the gold mine, the player with the most 9's may take one nugget from the mine for each nine he has thrown."
952,"Tens: In the bank, the player with the most 10's may rob the bank and take all bills there - each two bills represent one victory point at game end."
952,"Jacks: The player who has the most J's goes to the general store and draws as many cards as he had thrown J's, keeping one."
952,"These cards may give from one to eight points, or entitle a player to perform the saloon or general store action twice in a row, place a die with a result of a player's choice under the cup without rolling, or steal 4 dollars from another player."
952,There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.
952,"Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent."
952,"He may take as many cards from his opponent as he has thrown Q's, keeping one and giving back the others."
952,"Kings: The player with the most K's becomes the new sheriff; he decides who wins in any ties, but the sheriff can be influenced with nuggets, cards, or money."
952,"Aces/Poker hand: In the town hall, the player with the best poker hand gets a property claim worth from one to five victory points."
952,Having aces in the best poker hand permits taking additional cards.
952,"Finally, if a player did not win anything during a turn, he might visit Doc Badluck where he can choose any one of the following:
- equip oneself with barbed wire - the player has two property claims that cannot be stolen;
- draw the first card from the general store pile;
- all other players must give the player two dollars;
- an ace will bring a nugget from every other player."
952,The game ends when there are no more gold nuggets in the mine or when all property claims have been issued.
952,"Players count their points: 1 for each nugget, 1 for every two dollars, 5 for whomever is currently sheriff, and each general store and property card for its value."
953,"In 7 Wonders: Architects, 2-7 players race to become a leader of the ancient world by completing an architectural wonder that will last through the ages."
953,"Players receive an unconstructed wonder at the beginning of the game and must collect resources to build their society, develop military might to navigate conflicts, oversee resource management, research science improvements, and collect civil victory points as they race to leave their mark on world history."
954,The lunch break is almost there and all of the young penguins would finally get the fish they’ve been craving.
954,"However, some rascals think they are quick enough to snatch some of the fish before the lunch break starts, but they have forgotten one thing – the Hall Monitor!"
954,"Each school day one of the penguins is designated to watch over the school, and this is his moment to shine – for each rascal penguin he catches he would get additional fish!"
954,"A fun run takes place – the rascals are running everywhere and trying to snatch some fish on their way, but the Hall Monitor is trying to catch each and one of them to have some order in the school."
954,Who will be more successful?
954,"ICECOOL is a flicking game in which each round one of the players takes the role of the Hall Monitor (also called ""the Catcher"") – his aim will be to catch each other penguin and get points for that."
954,"The others (also known as ""Runners"") will try to run through several doors, thus gaining fish (that give them points) on their way."
954,"When either the Hall Monitor has caught each other penguin once or any of the others has gone through all 3 doors that have fish on them, the round is over."
954,Each player will take the role of the Hall Monitor once and at the end of the game the winner will be the one with the most points on their fish cards.
954,"The penguins can be flicked in a straight line, make curves and even jump over the walls!"
954,Each player will have to use the best of their skills in order to get the most points in this fun and exciting game.
954,"It's not just cool, it's ICECOOL!"
955,Sixty-Something Millions of Years Ago — A great ice age has ended.
955,"With massive warming altering the globe, another titanic struggle for supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species."
955,Dominant Species: Marine is a game that abstractly recreates a small portion of ancient history: the ending of an onerous ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.
955,"Each player will assume the role of one of four major aquatic-based animal classes — reptiles, fish, cephalopod or crustacean."
955,Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another.
955,"But that won’t last: It is indeed “survival of the fittest.”
Through wily action pawn placement, you will attempt to thrive in as many different habitats as possible in order to claim powerful card effects."
955,You will also want to propagate your individual species in order to earn victory points for your animal.
955,"You will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation actions, among others."
955,All of this eventually leads to the end game – the final ascent of a vast tropical ocean and its shorelines – where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have their animal crowned the Dominant Species.
955,"But somebody better become dominant quickly, because there’s a large asteroid heading this way....
Game Play
The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of the main ocean on earth as it might have appeared tens of millions of years ago."
955,"The smaller Hydrothermal Vent tiles will be placed atop some of the larger tiles throughout play, converting them into Vents in the process."
955,The action pawns drive the game.
955,"Each pawn allows a player to perform the various actions that can be taken—such as speciation, environmental change, migration or evolution."
955,"When placed on the action display, a pawn will immediately trigger that particular action for its owning player."
955,Dominant Species: Marine includes new “special” pawns that can be acquired during the course of play.
955,These special pawns have enhanced placement capabilities over the “basic” pawns that each player begins the game with.
955,"Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal’s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents’—hopefully collecting valuable victory points along the way."
955,"The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities, ongoing benefits, or an opportunity for recurring VP gains."
955,"Throughout the game species cubes will be added to, moved about on, and removed from the tiles in play (“earth”)."
955,Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth.
955,"When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile and score their controlled special pawns—after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game."
955,"Dominant Species Veterans

For players of the original Dominant Species, this iteration introduces several key evolutions to the system (pun definitely intended): 

 Actions are taken immediately whenever a pawn is placed instead of waiting to execute actions after all pawns are on the board."
955,"This gives players a bit more flexibility in their strategy, doesn’t increase game time when more pawns are acquired by players, and lessens the brain-burn quite a bit since it alleviates the burden of having to plan out an entire turn in advance."
955,"Domination is no longer on a per-tile basis, and is no longer ‘competitive’ with other players."
955,"In this game you check dominance for each element type over the entire earth, and whether or not you dominate an element type is independent of whether one or more opponents also dominate it."
955,Domination of an element is how you acquire – and try to maintain – control of the special pawns.
955,Animals no longer have default special abilities.
955,"Now, players are dealt 3 Trait cards during setup, choosing one to keep and putting the others back in the box."
955,The chosen Trait gives their animal one of eighteen unique abilities spread amongst the Trait cards.
955,Acquiring special pawns through domination gives a player great flexibility in planning and executing a strategy.
955,Special pawns can ‘bump’ an opponent’s basic pawn in order to take an action that would otherwise be blocked.
955,They can be placed anywhere on the action display (where basic pawns must be placed in top-to-bottom order only).
955,There are powerful action spaces where only a special pawn can be placed.
955,"And at the end of the game, each special pawn awards its owner VPs according to its highest achieved dominance value."

956,Thunderstone: Dragonspire is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion.
956,Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks.
956,"Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards."
956,"In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon."
956,A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together.
956,Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.
956,"Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon."
956,From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out.
956,"On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village."
956,Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village.
956,"If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters."
956,"The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power."
956,Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player.
956,If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck.
956,This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards.
956,In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions.
956,The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it.
956,The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.
956,"From the publisher:
Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire!"
956,"Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!"
956,"), and the all new ""Setting"" cards which alter the game on a global scale."
956,"Dragonspire includes 18 new village cards, 11 new heroes, and 8 new monster sets."
956,"With enough cards to play the game right out of the box, this is a great Thunderstone edition for those just getting into the game."
956,"Dragonspire also has a new storage box format, plastic XP tokens, and a brand new Dungeon board to help players keep up with light and darkness."
956,"Thunderstone: Dragonspire is not a an expansion, but is instead a separate stand-alone game that may be played along with components of Thunderstone."
956,NOTE: The Dragon-Humanoid divider included with the game is meant for a future expansion as a promo.

959,Numbers aren't worth anything in NMBR 9 unless they're off the ground floor and looking down from above.
959,The game includes twenty cards numbered 0-9 twice and eighty tiles numbered 0-9; each number tile is composed of squares in some arrangement.
959,"After shuffling the deck of cards, draw and reveal the first card."
959,Each player takes a number tile matching the card and places it on the table.
959,"With each new card drawn after that, each player takes the appropriate number tile, then adds it to the tiles that they already have in play, with each player building their own arrangement of tiles."
959,The new tile must touch at least one other tile on the same level along one side of a square.
959,"A tile can also be placed on top of two or more other tiles as long as no part of the new tile overhangs the tiles below it; new tiles placed on this same level must touch at least one other tile, while also covering parts of at least two tiles and not overhanging."
959,"Once all the cards have been drawn and the tiles placed, players take turns calculating their score."
959,"A tile on the bottom level — the 0th level, if you will — scores 0 points; a tile on the 1st level above this is worth as many points as the number on the tile; a tile on the 2nd level is worth twice the number on the tile; etc."
959,Whoever scores the most points wins!
960,"Irish Gauge — one of three titles in Winsome Games 2014 Essen Set — is played on a map of Ireland and is similar in style to many of the stock-based, cube-rail games released by Winsome Games since 2007."

960,The dividends are paid out to shareholders of certain railroads based on how many cities/towns they connect to and how many shares of this company have been issued.
960,The upgrade and dividend actions also affect game length and the likelihood of further dividends for each company.
960,"The game ends when a certain condition is met at the end of a player's turn, and the player with the highest sum of money and stock value at the end of this turn wins."
960,Irish Gauge is the first title in the Iron Rail series by Capstone Games.

964,"Cooperate temporarily with other builders in order to create paths and share goods, but do not forget your own objectives."
964,Will you have a statue erected in your honor on the Nebula City plaza?
964,"A game of Via Nebula starts with a board showing a hexagonal grid, some production sites with a few available resources on them (wood, stone, wheat, and pigs), building sites in various areas scattered over the whole board, and a lot of mist."
964,"Turn after turn, players have two actions at their disposal from these options: They may clear the mist of a hex to create new paths of transportation, open new production sites, open a building site in a city, carry resources from any production site to their own building sites, and, of course, achieve a construction."
964,Resources and paths through the mist may be used by all the players.
964,"This initially induces a kind of cooperation, but eventually other players will take advantage of your actions!"
964,"To achieve a construction, you fulfill a contract on one of your cards."
964,"You start the game with two contracts, and four more contracts are available for all players to see and use on a first come, first served basis — and that's where the cooperation abruptly stops."
964,"Additionally, most contracts have special powers that are triggered on completion."
964,The game ends when a player finishes a fifth building.
964,"Opponents each take two final actions, then players score based on the number of cleared hexes and opened production sites and the point value of their contracts, with a bonus for the player who ended the game."

966,Tide of Iron was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2007.
966,Tide of Iron: Next Wave was released under license by 1A Games in 2014.
966,"Even though Tide of Iron: Next Wave is essentially a second edition of Tide of Iron, things are a bit confusing here on BGG since the two games have separate Board Game Links."
966,"For more information about the newer 2014 version of Tide of Iron: Next Wave, you can Click Here."
966,Tide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players.
966,The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.
966,"Tide of Iron is a scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario."
966,"It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame."
966,"The twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations."
966,The only limiting factor is your imagination!
967,"The Hare & the Tortoise, originally published as Royal Turtle, is a card-driven betting game about animal racing loosely based on one of Aesop's Fables."
967,"At the start of a race, each player secretly bets on up to two of five animals: turtle, rabbit, lamb, wolf and fox."
967,"One animal is chosen at random for each player, then after receiving a hand of seven cards, each player places one of his cards face-down (possibly the same animal) as an additional bet."
967,"Players then take turns laying down 1-4 cards, with all cards needing to show the same animal, then refilling the hand to five cards."
967,"As soon as eight total cards have been played or four cards of any one animal, the animals move (maybe)."
967,Each animal has a distinct characteristic that players can use to their advantage.
967,"The turtle always moves one space, but it moves two if four of its cards were played."
967,The rabbit always moves two spaces as long as cards are played.
967,"— unless four cards are played and it's at the head of the pack, in which case it sleeps and doesn't move."
967,The fox moves as many spaces as the number of cards played.
967,"The lamb moves one more space than the number of cards played — but if it reaches water, it stops moving to take a drink."
967,"The wolf moves 1 space if one to two cards are played, and one less space than the number of cards if more are played."
967,"The wolf also has 3 cards with a howl, if one of these is played no one but the wolf moves."
967,"(The track consists of eleven road cards, two covered with water.)"
967,"After the animals move, players start a new round of card-playing."
967,"A round ends when three of the five animals reach the goal, after which each player scores points based on the ranking of the animals and how they bet."
967,"After three rounds, the player with the most points wins."
967,"The original title of Royal Turtle is a homage to Reiner Knizia's Royal Turf, another betting game about animals racing (albeit horses in that game)."
968,"Wilderness War is a card-driven wargame, dramatically simpler and more streamlined than either For the People or Paths of Glory, but the complexity still exceeds the classic Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but only just."
968,"In Wilderness War, the players get to re-fight the 7 Years War in North America."
968,"Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, à la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular & Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle."
968,"Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late."
968,"Wilderness War takes two players into the French & Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America."
968,It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory.
968,Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada.
968,"As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control."
968,Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war.
968,"The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies."
968,"The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians."
968,Relive the history of this exciting time when the fate of Canada hung in the balance.
968,"Wilderness War is by the designer of the more recent Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ?"
968,and Andean Abyss and other Series: COIN (GMT) games.

969,"In the drawing game Loony Quest, players study challenging level cards, then try to replicate the outline to meet targets and avoid obstacles on their tracing sheets."
969,"Once finished, players place their sheets on top of the level card to see whether the drawings line up with the targets they meant to hit — or avoid."
969,"Largely inspired by video games, Loony Quest players discover various worlds, play with 3D and 2D levels, run into loony monsters — Loonies — and big bosses, trigger special stages, collect bonuses, use penalties on opponents, and gather as many Xperience points as possible to win."
969,"Loony Quest features the same basic gameplay as in Doodle Quest, but has been developed differently by the publisher."

970,BattleCON: War of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head play.
970,Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat.
970,"Take control of 18 different characters, from a fire elemental, an ocean guardian and her panda familiar, a space-bending trapper, a shadowy assassin, and more!"
970,"Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master."
970,"Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share."
970,"There is no hidden information: you always know exactly what cards the opponent holds, just not the ones they'll choose!"
970,The last player standing wins!
970,BattleCON: War of Indines can be played on its own or combined with other BattleCON sets to create an even greater pool of characters and play variants.
970,"______________________________________________________________________________
BattleCON: War of Indines has two versions, now dubbed ""Classic"" and ""Remastered."""
970,"The ""Classic"" version contained multiple art styles, as different fighters were drawn by different artists."
970,"This version contains multiple errors and outdated cards, and is now permanently out of print."
970,"The new ""Remastered"" version features the same 18 fighters, but updated to match the uniform art style of Devastation of Indines."
970,"It also includes balance changes to a few fighters, new double-sided finishers, updated art and components, and a streamlined version of the rulebook that focuses on standard 2-player duels."

971,Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.
971,The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).
971,"Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more."
971,An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.
971,"One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the ""board"" created by facedown Corp cards."
971,"It has the feel of a ""capture the flag"" game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.
Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply ""playing with the rules"" itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner)."
971,"Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated."
971,The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.
971,"Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called ""The Big Sell Out"")."

972,"The other players are secretly dealt their role cards determining what kind of spirits they are ""good"" or  ""naughty"" or if they are just ""tricksters"" changing sides as the game goes by."
972,"The whole round lasts 120 seconds in which the spirits are drawing ""Dream"" cards depicting a specific element of the dream, trying to describe them to the dreamer using one word each."
972,"The dreamer can guess what the element of the Dream is at any time, placing the card to the good spirits team side if the guess was correct and in the naughty spirits pile if it was not."
972,"At the end of the round the Dreamer and the good spirits get a point for every card in the good spirits pile, when the naughty spirits get one point for every card in the naughty spirits pile."
972,"The tricksters get points according to how well balanced the two teams were at the end of the round, gaining extra points if they managed to equally balance the two piles."
972,"At the end of the round, the dreamer must use the words he guessed and story-tell his dream for extra points before he opens his eyes."
972,You can learn how to play in a few minutes and have a great laugh right from the start.

973,So far your first year at the Elementary College has been slightly disappointing.

973,"Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse."
973,"Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc."
973,— but the monsters from the book fight back.
973,Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time.

979,The Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game in which the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron.
979,"Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power."
979,"Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor."
979,Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks.
979,"These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory."
979,The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits.
979,"If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothlórien."
979,"By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption — not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts."
979,"As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer."
979,"Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between."
979,"You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated — and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring."
979,"To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom."
979,"This game should not be confused with Reiner Knizia's children's game (Lord of the Rings) with the same title, or with his very different two-player Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation."

A special edition limited to 500 copies in the English language and 250 in German published by Sophisticated Games and Kosmos in November 2001."

980,Our rovers have confirmed 1-6 viable colonization options.
980,Planet Unknown is a competitive game for 1-6 players in which players attempt to develop the best planet.
980,"Each round, each player places one polyomino-shaped, dual-resource tile on their planet."
980,Each resource represents the infrastructure needed to support life on the planet.
980,Every tile placement is important to cover your planet efficiently and also to build up your planet's engine.
980,"After placing the tile, players do two actions associated with the two infrastructure types on the tile."
980,"Some tile placements trigger ""meteors"" that make all planets harder to develop and prevent them from scoring points in the meteor's row and column."
980,"Planet Unknown innovates on the popular polyomino trend by allowing simultaneous, yet strategic turn-based play via the Lazy S.U.S.A.N."

981,Archaeology: The New Expedition is a reimplementation of the popular Archaeology: The Card Game (with several changes).
981,You are an archaeologist working the dig sites of the Egyptian desert.
981,"Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots, and other priceless artifacts."
981,Explore an ancient pyramid in the hope of uncovering a huge stash of treasure!
981,Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection.
981,Sell your treasures to the museum at just the right time for maximum profit.
981,"But beware, the desert also has its dangers!"
981,"A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!"
981,"In Archaeology: The New Expedition, you want to find treasures and make the most money possible by selling them to the museum."
981,"Players start with four treasure cards in hand; one monument tile is chosen at random, then the chambers of the monument are loaded secretly with treasure cards."
981,"On a turn, a player digs for treasure by drawing from the deck."
981,"If they find treasure, they don't show anyone and keep it; if they find a thief, they steal a card at random from an opponent; and if they find a sandstorm, all players lose half of their cards in hand to the marketplace, which starts the game with five face-up cards."
981,(Each player has a tent that they can discard to avoid the effects of one sandstorm.)
981,"After digging, a player can:

 Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them."
981,Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.
981,"Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth."
981,"Players can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order."
981,"Once the deck is empty, players keep taking actions until they all pass in turn, after which they sell treasures to the museum."
981,Whoever ends up with the most money wins!
981,"According to the designer, Archaeology: The New Expedition differs from Archaeology: The Card Game through the inclusion of tent cards, the addition of new treasure types and additional cards to allow for five players, the adjustment of some treasure values, and the inclusion of six monuments instead of one to have more variety when exploring."
982,"Along the lines of History of the World by The Avalon Hill Game Co, players cycle through a series of European civilizations as they attempt to score the most points using the civilization's special powers."
982,The game is set in Europe.
982,Each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.
982,"Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics."
982,"Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players."
982,The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one that will generate more points.
982,"Play continues with the cycling of civilizations until a certain score is reached, whereupon final rounds are played and a victor is determined."
982,"Reimplemented by:

983,Stronghold is a game telling the story of a siege.
983,"Players take opposite sides, one has to defend the stronghold, the other has to break into the castle as soon as possible."
983,"As time passes, defenders get Victory Points every turn for their efforts on the walls."
983,"The game board represents the stronghold itself as well as the surrounding terrain, where enemy forces are placed and whence they proceed to the walls."
983,"The defender has a small number of soldiers manning the walls, while the invader has an infinite legion of attacking creatures."
983,A desperate fight is taking place every single turn.
983,"The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them and use black magic rituals to achieve victory."
983,"Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers, and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible."
984,"Talented Urban planners and architects rival each other to construct luxury, elegant buildings of glass and steel, defying the laws of balance."
984,Who will eventually impose their style to leave an indelible trail in the history of the city?
984,The answer is in your hands!
984,The players are urban planners in quest of prestige.
984,"Over the course of the game, players will try to construct their buildings in the best locations."
984,"As soon as a player has placed all of their buildings, the game ends."
984,The player with the most prestige is the winner.
984,"Each turn a player will pick a space on the board and place one of their buildings (bidding markers) into the space, with the bidding number shown."
984,Each following player can then either pass or raise the bid by placing a higher numbered building into an adjacent space.
984,The eventual winner of the bid flips his building number side down and all losing bids are returned to players.
984,A new round commences.
984,"Spaces on the board are differentiated by Metro spaces, which are worth points and reward the player with the most at game end; archaeological sites, which are worth minus points and penalize the player who most recently built on one; and fashionable locations, which are just worth extra points."
984,"In addition, each player has up to two hidden agendas that they are secretly trying to achieve, such as trying to surround water fountains or occupy both sides of bridges."
985,"SCOUT is a ladder-climbing game in which cards have two potential values, players may not rearrange their hand of cards, and players may pass their turn to take a card from the current high set of cards into their hand."
985,"More specifically, cards are dual-indexed, with different values on each half of the card, with the 45 cards having all possible combinations of the numbers 1-10."
985,"During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation."
985,"Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand."
985,"On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:
• Play: A player chooses one or more adjacent cards in their hand that have all the same value or that have values in consecutive order (whether ascending or descending), then they play this set of cards to the table."
985,They can do this only if the table is empty (as on the first turn) or the set they're playing is ranked higher than the set currently on the table; a set is higher if it has more cards or has cards of the same value instead of consecutive cards or has a set of the same quantity and type but with higher values.
985,"In this latter case when a player overplays another set, the player captures the cards in this previous set and places them face down in front of themselves."
985,• Scout: A player takes a card from either end of the set currently on the table and places it anywhere they wish in their hand in either orientation.
985,Whoever played this previous set receives a 1 VP token as a reward for playing a set that wasn't beaten.
985,"Once per round, a player can scout, then immediately play."
985,"When a player has emptied their hand of cards or all but one player have scouted instead of playing, the round ends."
985,"Players receive 1 VP for each face-down card, then subtract one point for each card in their hand (except if they were the player scouted repeatedly to end the game)."
985,"Play as many rounds as the number of players, then whoever has the most points wins."
986,"In Batman: Gotham City Chronicles, one villain faces off against a team of heroes in one of multiple scenarios."
986,"Each hero has their own character, and they control this character by spending energy to perform actions (such as Melee and Ranged attacks, defusing bombs...) recovering more or less energy at the beginning of their turn depending on their stance."
986,"If the hero gets damaged, energy moves to a wound area, and if they lose all of their energy, then they're out of action for a while to recover their strength."
986,"Each hero has differing strengths for their abilities, and these strengths are represented by colored dice with different values; the more energy a hero spends on an ability, the more dice of that color they can roll."
986,"The villain controls a team of henchmen and iconic villains of the Batman universe, and these characters are represented by tiles on their command board, with the characters costing 1, 2, 3, etc."
986,energy to activate as you move left to right down the line.
986,"Once a character is activated, they move to the end of the line, boosting their cost to the maximum value should you want to use them again immediately, and decreasing the cost of the other tiles."
986,"The game-play in Batman: Gotham City Chronicles is based on that of Conan, with revisions to character abilities, the addition of two different types of dice (w/ five types total), and a modified two-player set-up, the Versus Mode, in which each player has a command board and their own team of tiles that they can draft, with heroes facing off against villains."
987,Era: Medieval Age serves as the spiritual successor to Roll Through The Ages.
987,"While Roll Through The Ages was a pioneer for roll-and-write-style games, Era is a pioneer for roll-and-build!"
987,"In Era, your dice represent different classes of medieval society as players attempt to build the most prosperous city."
987,"The ""build"" comes into play as players actually build their cities on their boards."
987,"You will use beautifully modeled three-dimensional components such as walls, keeps, farms, and other structures."
987,"By the end of the game, each player will have a unique city of their very own!"
987,"Era: Medieval Age is made even more challenging as players interact with each other in ways such as extortion, scorched earth, and, of course, disease!"
987,"Hey, this is the Medieval Age, right?"

991,360 animals on big cards are waiting for the players of Fauna.
991,Every round a single animal presents itself by name and picture.
991,"The 2-6 players try to guess the animal's weight, length, height, tail length and - most important - the areas in which the animal lives on the Earth."
991,The early bird gets the worm: an area on the big map or a sector on the scales already occupied by a player token cannot be chosen a second time.
991,When no player wants to set another token the round ends and the scoring is performed.
991,"Tokens on correct spaces get points for the corresponding player, also tokens in the direct neighborhood of correct spaces score points."
991,Tokens not earning points are temporarily out of the game - so risk should be carefully considered.
991,Next round - next animal - starting player changes.
991,The first player who reaches a certain total score wins (normally after 8-12 animals).
992,"The Reckoners, a game based on the young adult fantasy novels by Brandon Sanderson, allows players to take on the roles of the novels' protagonists and work together to save the world."
992,"Background:
10 years ago... A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers."
992,They're called Epics.
992,"But, every Epic turned out to be evil."
992,"Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named Steelheart reigns supreme!"
992,Nobody fights back... nobody but the Reckoners!

992,Take down Steelheart and his Epics and save the city.
992,"Gameplay:
The Reckoners is a simultaneous, co-operative game for 1-6 players that plays in 75 minutes."
992,You win by defeating Steelheart.
992,"But before you can defeat him, you must first discover his weakness."
992,"Throughout the game, you will work with your fellow Reckoners to research and attack Steelheart, but he is not alone."
992,"Numerous Epics are scattered throughout the city, and they will wreak havoc upon the population, if left unchecked."
992,"If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then all Reckoners lose."
992,"The Reckoners determine which actions to take primarily through a simultaneous, dice rolling mechanism, where each player can keep and reroll results up to three times at their own pace."
992,Equipment Cards and Plan Tokens will also allow you to gain extra actions or improve/manipulate the results of your dice.
992,"Actions are resolved simultaneously as well, so communication and collaborative planning are key to ensuring optimal outcomes."
992,"Your dice can be used to attack Epics, research Epics, contain Epics, attack Enforcement, earn money, acquire Plan Tokens, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers."
992,"Researching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness."
992,"But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely."
992,"When all actions have been taken by The Reckoners, then it's the Epics turn."
992,"Each round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round."
992,"Each Epic also has a unique set of actions it performs, so you're always facing multiple threats that function very differently."
992,The crux of the game is deciding how to resolve these competing threats and prioritize your actions together to eliminate Epics and ultimately win the game.
992,"How, when, and where you act will determine your victory or failure."
992,"Summary:
In short, The Reckoners plays like a challenging, ever-shifting puzzle."
992,"If you like co-operative games where you carefully manage resources, build powerful action combos, create tactical plans with your teammates, and work together to take down the bad guy while on the brink of defeat, then be sure to check out The Reckoners."

993,"In Terror in Meeple City (formerly known as Rampage), you arrive in Meeple City as a gigantic, famished, scaly-skinned monster!"
993,"Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples – in short: sow terror while having fun."
993,The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.
993,"The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors."
993,Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city.
993,"Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board."
993,"On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:

Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc."
993,"Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them."
993,"Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster."
993,"Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board."
993,"Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action."
993,"After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have."
993,"If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food!"
993,"Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen)."
993,"For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end."
993,"You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card."
993,"In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use."
993,"Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players."

994,Do you have what it takes to out ranch your opponents and operate the most successful dinosaur farm!?
994,"Tiny Epic Dinosaurs is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of dinosaur ranching, worker-placement and resource management."

994,The game is played over 6 rounds.
994,With each round consisting of several short phases.
994,"In phase one, players will harvest the resources from their farm that are not being consumed by dinosaurs."
994,"In phase two, players will put their ranchers to work."
994,"This phase has ranchers wrangling and buying new dinosaurs to farm, improving their farm’s security and supplies, vying for high dollar contracts, and researching technologies and unique dinosaur breeds."
994,These unique dinosaur breeds introduce a large variety of special benefits players can utilize to separate themselves from their competition.
994,"In phase three, ranchers return to finish their day’s work at the farm."
994,"In phase four, players arrange their ranch, making sure their ranch is suitable for the types of dinosaurs they have."
994,"Phase five is the feeding phase, and every dinosaur MUST be fed."
994,"Dinosaurs that don’t eat will escape, posing a grave threat to your enclosures’ security and your other dinosaurs."

995,"Abluxxen), you take turns playing number cards, and the more cards of the same number you play, the better as cards score points at the end of the game."
995,"If someone else plays the same amount of cards with a higher number, however, your cards get nicked!"
995,"Stealing cards can be good, but if you can't use them later, and end the game with cards in hand, they'll cost you points."
995,"In more detail, the deck contains 104 number cards (1-13 x8) and five joker cards."
995,"Each player starts with a hand of 13 cards, and six cards are laid face-up next to the deck."
995,"On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same value, adding jokers if desired; if she already has cards on the table, she lays these cards so that previously played cards are still visible."
995,"If any opponent has most recently played the same number of cards and those cards are of a lower value, then the active player ""abluxxes"" those opponents — that is, the active player can take the abluxxed cards into her hand and the opponent then draws the same number of cards, either from the display or the deck; if she doesn't take these cards in hand, then the opponent either returns these cards to his hand or discards them and draws that many cards."
995,Refill the display only after someone finishes drawing cards.
995,"(Jokers can be played on their own, and they are considered to be higher than all values.)"
995,"As soon as the deck runs out of cards or a player has no cards in hand, the game ends immediately, even if the player would normally abluxx an opponent."
995,"Each player scores one point for each card on the table in front of him, then loses one point for each card in hand."
995,Whoever has the highest score wins.
995,"If players wish, they can play multiple rounds and sum their scores over the rounds to determine a winner."

996,The police take no chance and ask the most eminent people of the city to help them in the chase of The Ripper.
996,"You will need to Investigate whether Francis J. Tumblety the real Mr. Jack, or if it is someone else."
996,"Mr. Jack in New-York is a complete game all on its own, however it is recommend for a beginner to play Mr. Jack first."

998,"Each faction involves a different gaming mechanism - the pirates move the cards, the zombies bring back the cards from the discard pile, the dinosaurs have enormous power - and each combination of factions brings a different gaming experience."
998,"During the game, basic cards (each with their own difficulties and abilities) are at stake."
998,You try to have the most power on the basis of your minions when the base is broken.
998,Sounds easy?
998,Is it easy when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to tie your minions to other Bases - flat Murder them?
998,"What happens when the Pirate-Dinosaur Full Sails player and frees King Rex to trample your minions in the ground, or when wizard-zombies use their mystic power to create an outbreak, suddenly flooding minions on the base of the discard pile?"
998,Or if you were facing a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an epidemic of massive beasts at the same time?!?
998,"When a base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points."
998,Fourth place?
998,"Sorry, brother, next time."
998,"With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try."
998,"Pirate-Aliens play different Ninja-Aliens, for example."
998,Which one will you use to crush your opponents?
998,And did we mention dinosaurs have laser beams?

999,China is an abstracted game of political influence in China.
999,Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board.
999,"When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region."
999,"At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions."

999,They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.
999,China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht.
999,"China differs from Web of Power in that there is no ""half-time"" scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not."
999,A special variant with fortifications is included.
999,"Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same."

1002,"Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory."
1002,Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn.
1002,Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds?
1002,"Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat."
1002,"If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!"

1003,"If they end their movement in a space with a treasure, they may pick it up and place it in their backpack."
1003,"If they end their movement in a space with a ghost, they fight that ghost by rolling a fight die."
1003,"If they roll the matching symbol, they remove the ghost from the game board."
1003,"If the players must add a third ghost to a room, it transforms into a haunting."

1009,Runebound is a classic adventure game from Fantasy Flight Games in which mighty heroes must take on the perils of Terrinoth.
1009,"The game can be largely played without conflict between the players but victory can only be claimed by the first player to defeat the Dragonlord Margath, so the players are actually in a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armour and allies in order to take on the final adversary."
1009,Runebound features a series of 4 Adventure Decks that helps to pace the speed of the game and ensures that the players level up by acquiring experience before they are ready to take on a harder set of challenges (events and monsters).

1011,"Suit Actions are also taken by the winner of each trick, as well as at the end of a full Round of play."
1011,"Suit Actions will enable players to take Diamond Crystals from the Supply, moving them to their Showroom (where they may score 1 point) or to their Vault (where they will score 2 points)."

1011,"One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible."
1011,"As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get a Suit Action in the suit you did play."
1011,"The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets a Suit Action."
1011,The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick.
1011,"After a full Round of ten tricks, whoever has taken the most cards in each suit once again gets a Suit Action."
1011,"If a player has taken no tricks, that player gets two Diamonds Suit Actions."
1011,Players then start a new round.

1013,"Each player starts with a supply of 17 double-decker buses, two transportation cards in hand, and one or two destination tickets that show locations in London."
1013,"On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up bus, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them."
1013,"Players take turns until someone has no more than two buses in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game."
1013,"Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected."
1013,"(A district consists of 2-4 locations, and you score 1-5 points for a district if you link all of its locations to one another with your buses.)"
1013,"You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!"

1017,"All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices."

1019,"From the publisher:
A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn."
1019,"The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go."
1019,"Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8."
1019,"Theme:
Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the ""many roads that lead to divine wisdom"", and the game as a whole representing ""the classic quest for enlightenment""."
1019,This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.
1019,"Gameplay:
The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player."
1019,Each player has a hand of tiles.
1019,"On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token."
1019,"If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game."
1019,The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board.
1019,Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.
1019,"Other notes:
Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time."
1019,Somewhat similar to Metro and Spaghetti Junction.
1020,"Massive Darkness brings the classic fantasy RPG experience to modern board gaming, with an action-packed campaign chock full of gorgeous miniatures and a streamlined system that keeps the focus on the heroes' actions, with no need for a game master to control the enemies."
1020,"Using the popular Zombicide system as a starting point, Massive Darkness adds all the richness of a dungeon crawl RPG."
1020,"Pick your hero, choose a class, decide on which skills to spend your XP, and get loot by searching the dungeon or killing special enemies that can use the equipment against you!"
1020,"Face a multitude of different enemy types, coming in all shapes and sizes, whose behavior is resolved automatically...or you can try to sneak around enemies by taking advantage of dark areas of the map."
1020,Players begin their adventure in Massive Darkness by picking a Hero – each with two special starting skills – and pair them with a Class of their choosing.
1020,"Depending on the combination, another skill can be unlocked, giving players a wide range of choices and play styles."
1020,"In Massive Darkness, the created Heroes go on Quests, killing monsters, collecting loot, and gaining XP."
1020,"Players spend their XP to unlock new Skills, growing more powerful as the Quest progresses."
1020,"Throughout the game, players encounter different monsters, including Minions, Agents, Roaming Monsters, and Bosses."
1020,An unique mechanism of the game is the Guardian.
1020,"Any of the monster types have a chance of spawning as a Guardian, meaning it will use a random piece of equipment in the fight against Heroes."
1020,"However, if players are able to overcome this difficult encounter, they will acquire that piece of loot!"
1021,"In Automania, you run a car factory, trying to produce the most popular cars in the market."
1021,"To achieve this, you buy tiles to upgrade and customize your factory, and hire specialist employees to help you."
1021,"Central to the game are the factory boards: Each player has a factory with three assembly lines, and each assembly line produces one type of car."
1021,You can put machine tiles along your assembly lines to change the specifications of your cars.
1021,"However, your three assembly lines intersect, so each machine tile placed might affect more than one type of car — which means you have to think carefully about where you put those machines."
1021,"When a car is produced, it must be sold in one of two markets, and the better the specifications of the car is in line with the demand in the chosen market, the more popular the car will be."
1021,"The most popular cars reap the highest profits, earning money or prestige — which is what you need to win this game."
1022,Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.
1022,"From the Main Rulebook:
In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory."
1022,Each hero comes from a different people.
1022,"The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors."
1022,"The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men."
1022,The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous.
1022,"Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin."
1022,"The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land."
1022,"Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world."
1022,In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon.
1022,Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them.
1022,"They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs."
1022,"Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch."
1022,"If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power."
1022,"The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!"
1022,Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played.
1022,"Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win."
1022,"Also, there is no single board."
1022,"Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play."
1022,The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with.
1022,The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards.
1022,The hugely thick Role-play Book is all extra and alternative material that introduces you to a whole new hobby of role-playing Warhammer Quest.

1023,Unfurl the banners of the Great Houses of Westeros!
1023,"To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths."
1023,"Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal."
1023,But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.
1023,"In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R."
1023,"Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own."
1023,"In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock’s endless supply of gold."
1023,"Battles of Westeros is played over a series of included scenarios, called battles."
1023,"Each of these has a battle plan that dictates the formation of the map (called the battlefield), starting positions of each House’s units, starting resources, special rules, and victory conditions for the game session."
1023,"A battle is played over several rounds, with each round consisting of alternating player turns."
1023,"The goals a player needs to accomplish to win a game of Battles of Westeros can vary (some battles require players to earn a certain number of victory points, while other battles require a player to take and hold strategic positions on the battlefield), but this collection of available scenarios, along with the ability to make your own exciting battles with the double-sided map board and over thirty map overlays, gives Battles of Westeros a wealth of replayability!"
1023,"Battles of Westeros also offers plenty of strategic complexity, resulting in a satisfying number of compelling choices in every game."
1023,"For example, each player has a special randomized Leadership Deck, consisting of unique tactics and abilities; this deck will change based on the scenario being played and characters present."
1023,Is Jaime Lannister on the battlefield?
1023,"If you draw the appropriate Leadership Card, he can order nearby troops to aggressively rush their opponents!"
1023,Is Eddard Stark guiding his forces into battle?
1023,"Special flanking maneuvers enter your Leadership Deck, to potentially be drawn into your hand."
1023,Battles of Westeros also features a level of realism that immerses you in the most significant conflicts of the War of the Five Kings.
1023,"Each plastic figure base, which holds your infantry, archer, cavalry, and kennelmaster units, has a slot for a banner pole – a small flag-bearing attachment."
1023,"The plastic banners that attach to each unit bear the crest of that unit’s house, and their orientation on the pole indicates at a glance whether that unit has been ordered yet."
1023,"In addition to the intuitive and useful game effect this provides (differentiating the units you’ve activated from those you haven’t), the sight of your army’s banners spread impressively across the gorgeously designed game board will give you the sense that you are the clever Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock... or the stoic Robb Stark, with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side!"
1024,"The deluxe edition features:
- Updated artwork
- All components upgraded to true deluxe
- You will be able to ""set up” your own experience of YEDO."
1024,"Whether you want no negative interaction or a game more punishing than ever before, you will be able to set up YEDO to suit your needs and pause play style."
1024,"- New modular components brings a lot of interesting mechanisms into Yedo: the Tea house with a set of unique helpers who'll join you for a turn, Specialists in place of regular Disciples, new types of missions and much, much more!"
1024,"About the game:
Japan, 1605 – Hidetada Tokugawa has succeeded his father as the new Shogun, ruling from the great city of Edo (a.k.a."
1024,"Yedo), the city known in present times as Tokyo."
1024,This marks the beginning of the golden age of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the so-called Edo Period that will last until 1868.
1024,"Naturally, the most powerful families in Edo immediately try to curry favor with the new Shogun – and this is the opportunity our clan has been looking for, our chance at power and glory."
1024,Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun.
1024,We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans.
1024,We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat.
1024,We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us.
1024,We will find glory and honor in the eyes of this new Shogun – or failing that we will end his rule by any means necessary.
1024,"In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate."
1024,"The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions."
1024,"To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and – most importantly – outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions."
1024,There are several ways to reach your goal.
1024,Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye?
1024,Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience?
1024,You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants.
1024,"It's all up to you – but be careful to make the right choices, for in Yedo, eternal glory and painful disgrace are two sides of the same coin"
1025,"Clever hoch drei features the same gameplay as Ganz schön clever and Doppelt so clever, but with new categories in which to score — sometimes with several dice at the same time."
1025,"Your goal: Choose dice, then place the numbers into the matching colored area, put together tricky chain-scoring opportunities, and rack up the points."
1025,"The dice you don't use are as important as what you do because every die that's smaller than the chosen one can be used by the other players, keeping everyone in the game at all times."
1026,King Arthur is searching for a worthy heir.
1026,"Together with Merlin, he tries to find the best candidate among the Knights of the Round Table."
1026,"In Merlin, players move their knights or Merlin with the help of dice around the action ring to get the most desired actions."
1026,"While the knights are only moved by the corresponding player, Merlin can be moved by all players, which makes integrating Merlin in one's plan a tricky endeavor."
1026,"There are multiple ways to score victory points such as defeating barbarians, building manors in the surrounding area and increasing one's influence in the six counties."
1026,"Additionally, players can fulfill task cards during their turn to get more victory points."
1026,The player who plans his actions most efficiently will ultimately have the most points and thus will be the royal successor of King Arthur.
1027,Quarto has a 4×4 board and 16 pieces.
1027,"Each piece has four dichotomous attributes — color, height, shape, and consistency — so each piece is either black or white, tall or short, square or round, and hollow or solid."
1027,The object is to place the fourth piece in a row in which all four pieces have at least one attribute in common.
1027,The twist is that your opponent gets to choose the piece you place on the board each turn.
1028,"Game description from the publisher:
Mrs. Plumpert's prized pot pie has gone missing, and now it's a chicken chase to crack the case!"
1028,"In Outfoxed, you move around the board to gather clues, then use the special evidence scanner to rule out suspects."
1028,You have to work together quickly because the guilty fox is high-tailing it towards the exit!
1028,Will you halt the hungry hooligan before it flies the coop — or will you be outfoxed?
1029,"Yggdrasil is a co-operative game in which players are different gods of the Norse mythology: Odin, Thor, Tyr, Frey, Heimdall and Freyja."
1029,"Monsters, the wolf Fenrir, the huge serpent Jormungand, the Fire Giant Surt, the Goddess of the Dead Hel, the traitor Loki and the cosmic dragon Nidhögg are moving forward in Asgard inescapably and announce the impending coming of chaos and destruction on the world-tree Yggdrasil."
1029,"Together the players have to resist to the impending coming of the Evil forces in Asgard, the gods' world."
1029,"Game flow
During his turn, the active player first draws an Enemy card, corresponding to one of the six Evil creatures."
1029,The corresponding counter is moved one space forward in Asgard and the associated effect applies.
1029,"Then the active player performs three different actions among the nine at his disposal in order to resist to the advance:

Ask for the Elves' help
Get (or improve) a Weapon from the Dwarves
Send the Valkyries looking for Vikings' souls on the mankind world of Midgard
Fight the Fire Giants and try to gather the parts of a magic rune
Negotiate with the Vanir
Get rid of the Fire Giants who invade Midgard
Get the Vikings back from Hel's world
Exchange forces with another god
Fight against the Enemies in Asgard

Each player, depending on the god he plays, has a specific power that allows him to perform some actions better."
1029,All of these actions have to be used at the right moment or the victory will be unreachable.
1029,"The players will need cleverness, calm, and team spirit to challenge the game."
1030,Chimera Station brings a new twist to the worker placement genre: customizable workers.
1030,"Each worker can be modified in-game by splicing claws, tentacles, leaves or additional brains (or any combination of those) on them."
1030,"These workers are used to gather resources: points, food, credits, and living parts of aforementioned workers!"
1030,During the game you'll build and expand the space station and open up tons of different strategic and tactical possibilities.
1030,"Featuring a grand total of 12 standard action spaces and 40 additional ones (modules), 22 perks, 16 different ways to configure your aliens (via components), and 4 different races, the possibilities are endless!"
1030,"Artwork has been done by Brian Patterson from the webcomic ""d20Monkey""."
1031,"(from GMT's website:)
No Retreat: The Russian Front is a new deluxe edition of the  two-player Victory Point Games 2008 CSR Award Nominee wargame that retells the story of the titanic struggle between the invading armies of Nazi Germany versus Communist Russia during WW2 at a player-friendly and manageable level of scope and difficulty."
1031,This edition combines both the original game and its two extensions (Na Berlin!
1031,and No Surrender!)
1031,using deluxe components of “Twilight Struggle Deluxe Edition” quality.
1031,"With only 40 Army/Front sized counters for the Tournament game, and 70 for the whole campaign, and with very low stacking, it’s a quick-playing yet realistic affair that favours the strategic and offensive-minded player."
1031,Each turn is alight with intriguing on-board challenges plus the surprise of card hand Events as players vie to win in one of three different ways.
1031,"In a skillfully blended collation of classic hex-based wargaming and modern card-driven simulations, No Retreat: The Russian Front  stays truly story-centric, providing the proper feel of sweeping maneuvers, exploitation and encirclements across the vast steppes and forests of Russia."
1031,"With a simple-yet-innovative economic model, players will also feel the growing might and sophistication of the Russian’s Red Army, and the degradation of the once-invincible German Wehrmacht, over the epic four year sweep of time that this merciless campaign was fought."
1031,"Neither side can afford the disgrace of yielding an inch of ground to their hated foe, so your orders are: “No Retreat!”

1032,"Shadow Hunters is a survival board game set in a devil-filled forest in which three groups of characters—the Shadows, creatures of the night; the Hunters, humans who try to destroy supernatural creatures; and the Neutrals, civilians caught in the middle of this ancient battle—struggle against each other to survive."
1032,You belong to one of these groups and must conceal your identity from others since you don't know whom you can trust—at least not initially.
1032,"Over time, though, someone might decipher who you are through your actions or through Hermit cards, or you might even reveal yourself to use your special ability."
1032,"The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early because once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack with impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or their equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch."
1032,"This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious—or a civilian, in the right circumstances, might claim victory."
1032,"The 2011 edition of Shadow Hunters from Z-Man Games includes the Shadow Hunters Expansion, a set of ten new characters previously sold separately."
1033,The animals want to show how good they are at making tall pyramids!
1033,"They must be skillfully careful: Who will position the penguin on top of the crocodile, the sheep on top of the penguin, the serpent on the sheep?"
1033,The hedgehog wants to stand on top of the pyramid but the height is making him dizzy.
1033,Tier auf Tier (a.k.a.
1033,"Animal Upon Animal, Pyramide d'animaux, and Dier op dier) is a simple stacking game, listed for ages 4-99, with 29 cute wooden animals."
1033,"Each turn a player rolls the die and either places one or two animals on to the stack of animals, passes one of his or her animals to another player for them to place, or places an animal on the table, extending the base for other players to build upon."
1033,"Of course, if any pieces fall off whilst you are building, you get up to two of them back."
1033,The first player to have used all of their animals wins.
1033,"This game, intended for children, is equally popular with adults."
1034,Honshu is a map-building card game set in feudal Japan.
1034,Players are lords and ladies of noble houses seeking new lands and opportunities for fame and fortune.
1034,"One game of Honshu lasts twelve rounds, and each round is divided into two phases."
1034,"First, map cards are played in a trick, and the player who played the highest valued card gets to pick first from those cards played."
1034,Then the players use the map cards picked to expand their personal maps.
1034,Each player must expand their personal maps to maximize their scoring possibilities.
1034,Manipulating your position in the player order is crucial for mastering Honshu.
1035,"Coconuts is a dexterity game based on the ""Monkey King"" character from Chinese mythology."
1035,"In the game, players launch coconuts toward a field of cups in the middle of the playing area."
1035,"Land in a cup, and you get to stack it on your player board; land in a cup on someone else's board, and you get to move it to yours."
1035,"By playing special ""Monkey King Magic"" cards, you can force opponents to shoot blind, take long shots, or otherwise bollix their efforts to cup a coconut."
1035,Whoever first completes a pyramid of six cups on his player board wins!

1036,"This population, also known as the Huron Nation, lived in the Great Lakes region, together with the tribes who formed the Iroquois Confederacy, and many others."
1036,"In this game, you will explore the traditions and everyday life of these tribes during the 1756–1763 period, when the Seven Years’ War between the French and the English took place in these territories."
1036,"But this white man’s war is only a marginal aspect of the game; the focus is on life in the native villages, fields, and forests."
1036,"In this game, you won’t find the traditional tipis, which were used by southwestern tribes who moved their camps to follow the bison herds."
1036,"The natives of the Great Lakes were more sedentary, living in longhouses."
1036,"The women farmed beans, corn, and pumpkins, while the men hunted beavers in the forests, mainly to sell their pelts as leather."
1036,"In Wendake, you step into the shoes of the chief of a Native American tribe."
1036,"You will have to manage the most important aspects of your tribe’s daily existence, thereby earning points on the Economic, Military, Ritual, and Mask tracks."

1037,"In the fast and goofy family game Galaxy Trucker, players begin by simultaneously rummaging through the common warehouse, frantically trying to grab the most useful component tiles to build their spaceship — all in real-time."
1037,"Once the ships are launched, players encounter dangerous situations while vying for financial opportunities, each hoping to gain the most valuable cargo and finish with as much of their ship still intact as possible."
1037,"Of course, that's easier said than done since many hazards will send pieces of your ship, your cargo, and your crew hurling into the depths of space."
1037,The goal is to survive the trek — hopefully with at least some of your crew and ship intact — and have at least one credit by the end of the game.
1037,"(Profit, yay!)"
1037,"Players earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, having the best-looking ship, and reaching their destination before the others."
1037,"This version of Galaxy Trucker is a relaunch of the original 2007 release by Vlaada Chvátil that features new art, more ship tiles, tweaked card effects, and streamlined gameplay that consists of only a single flight through space."
1037,"That said, should you want a longer, more challenging experience, you can play a three-flight game known as the ""Transgalactic Trek""."
1038,"Julius Caesar is a two-player game, depicting the later Roman civil wars (49-45 BC)."

1040,You can find the PDF for this card in the files section of this page.
1040,The missing card also comes in both the Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem – Grim Bastards Club Expansion and Sons of Anarchy: Men of Mayhem – Calaveras Club Expansion.

1041,"Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group."
1041,Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character.
1041,"Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A."
1041,"After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12."

1043,"Battle goblins, foil the plot of an evil lord, and add a new story to your tale!"
1043,"Prepare for Adventure
Legacy of Dragonholt is a narrative adventure game that creates a unique experience by blending aspects of roleplaying and adventure games, open world concept video games, and even Choose Your Own Adventure books."
1043,"Unlike many games, Legacy of Dragonholt is not about winning or losing, but rather about the act of creating a story."
1043,"Without the need for a Game Master, this game ensures that every player has the opportunity to shape how their adventure plays out while its intuitive gameplay means that you waste little time before jumping into your tale."
1043,"Before you first set out on your adventure, you must confront one of the most difficult questions in gaming: who will you become?"
1043,"Legacy of Dragonholt gives you the opportunity to play as one of six humanoid races that reside in Terrinoth: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, and catfolk."
1043,"Next, you'll select a class, before defining your physical and personality traits, and scribing a personal history."
1043,"Each of these features creates a multifaceted character and defines the types of traits you possess, which in turn affect how you will approach obstacles throughout your journey and how you'll contribute to your party."
1043,"For an in-depth look at the character creation process, you may look at our previous article here."
1043,"Once you've created your own unique character, you're ready to dive in to a narrative adventure unlike any you’ve seen before."

Once your journey begins, Legacy of Dragonholt combines two forms of gameplay between the comprehensive Village Book and the six quest books that provide the plotlines of your tales."
1043,"Within Dragonholt Village, you will encounter many colorful characters, each with their own stories that progress and interweave regardless of your involvement."
1043,"The world is yours to explore, but it is not yours to control."
1043,"Like a real community, the places you can explore vary depending on when you visit, and your encounters with the locals change depending on your traits and past experiences."
1043,"For instance, a bakery may only be open early in the day, and the baker themselves may take a shine to you if you’ve already met their cousin, or if they’ve heard of the great deeds you’ve accomplished earlier in your stay in the village."
1043,"Outside the relative safety of the village, thrilling dangers and mysteries await that you can experience in six unique quests."
1043,"You will investigate strange happenings within in the village and venture into the wilds beyond to journey through deep woods, delve into dark crypts, and confront creatures long thought dead."
1043,"As you progress throughout the game you will find that, like your village experience, your quests also change based on your past experience, who you have or have not met, and how much time has passed."
1043,"After all, if you learn that someone is in peril to the west of Dragonholt Village, they are not likely to wait patiently for three days while you explore in the east."
1043,"Your actions have consequences, but ultimately the choice lies with you."
1043,You do not have to be a hero.
1043,"This is your story, and it is yours to define."

1044,"(from GMT website:)
Colombia: Nation at the Edge of Abyss
Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the world’s last Marxist guerrilla armies, brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as a state."
1044,"A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization."
1044,"The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights."
1044,"Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror."
1044,Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.
1044,Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.
1044,"Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia—smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors."
1044,"A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame
From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip."
1044,"Most of the game’s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities."
1044,Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.
1044,There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable—and the unforeseeable.
1044,Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.
1044,"Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire
Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction."
1044,"For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions ."
1044,"Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels."
1044,"The non-player insurgents will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat."
1044,"Series: COIN (GMT), Volume I
Andean Abyss presents a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus our new COunterINsurgency series)."
1044,A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons.
1044,"Series: COIN (GMT) Volume II is Cuba Libre—Castro's Insurgency 1957-1958, Volume III is A Distant Plain—Insurgency in Afghanistan, and Volume IV is Fire in the Lake—Insurgency in Vietnam."

1048,You can play any two competitions in combination or play all three simultaneously.
1048,Each competition interacts with the other two.
1048,"To win, you need to balance your strategy and play all the competitions well."

1049,"It is the late 1930s, and the world is in turmoil."
1049,Humanity is on the brink of war as imperialist nations in the Far East and Europe work aggressively to expand their domination.

1049,"Featuring a beautifully rendered adventure map of the world as the game board, eight pulp adventure heroes to choose from (such as Jake Zane the Flying Ace, Li Mei Chen the Night Club Singer and Martial Artist, or Dr. Zhukov Master of Science), an army of ruthless villains and thugs (including the Chicago Mob and the dreaded occult-hunting Nazis), ancient Mayan temples to explore with a zeppelin hovering overhead, a wealth of coins to horde as heroes collect fortune and glory throughout the game, and a unique mechanism of dangers to overcome and the classic cliffhanger moments of suspense that can result."
1049,Fortune and Glory is designed to create a pulp serial cinematic feel as the story and game unfold.
1049,"So strap on your adventure boots and goggles, fire up the engines on the seaplane, and grab some extra ammo for your revolver...the Nazis already have a head start and in this race for fortune and glory, and there's no prize for second place!"

1051,Rules Clarification
1052,"Description from the publisher:
Welcome to the realm of Rokugan: a land of samurai and mystics, mad dragons and divine beings — a land where honor is stronger than steel."
1052,"Here, the clans serve the Emperor and engage in courtly deceptions and power plays, even as they wage war against each other and the evil forces that plague their realm."
1052,This is the world of Legend of the Five Rings!
1052,"Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game is a Living Card Game set in the world of Rokugan, the original setting for the Legend of the Five Rings collectible card game."
1052,"To play a Living Card Game, players create individual decks of cards from a base game with a fixed set of cards; they can then add supplemental card packs to this game world, with each pack also having a fixed set of cards, in order to vary their game experience."
1052,"While the connection of Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game to Rokugan and the Colonies — as well as its pervasive themes of honor, nobility, magic, intrigue, duty, and warfare — should carry over from the original L5R CCG, Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game is not compatible with that original game and will feature significant changes in the game mechanisms."
1053,"Higher and higher, the construction grows."
1053,"Before long, the steel girders reach dizzying heights."
1053,"Fearlessly, the workers carry on, with nothing more than hardhats to protect them."

1054,Watson & Holmes is a game of deduction set within the magnificent works of Arthur Conan Doyle.
1054,"Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries."
1054,"Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made."
1054,"Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case."
1054,The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story.
1054,"Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else."
1054,Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.
1054,"The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else."
1054,"To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located."
1054,"Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location."
1054,"Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location."
1054,They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate.
1054,"Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns."
1054,"This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct."
1054,"If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues."
1054,"Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself."

(BGG description:)
This is the 4th entry in the We the People system of games, following Hannibal and Successors (but pre-dating Paths of Glory, which is arguably more of a spin-off than a follow-on)."
1055,"The playing area is much larger than say Hannibal, there are lots more forces and generals, and there is a much more complicated political control/strategic will system - as well as quite a few other significant elements."
1055,"While still clean and streamlined for a complicated wargame, this is nontheless more of a serious hobby game than any of the previous entries in the genre."
1055,"(Note from Mark Herman:)
The game was reprinted and the latest and final version of the rules has incorporated all of the previous FAQs plus has re-written some of the more troublesome rules sections (rivers)."
1055,"To date, after a grueling three-year on-line tournament, no rules questions of note have been forthcoming."
1055,"The above write up is mistaken when it states that ""For The People"" is based on ""Hannibal v Rome"", but was my second game in the ""We The People"" genre that I created."
1055,The game dropped my battle card system in lieu of a more traditional combat results table to speed play and increase historical accuracy.
1055,"UPDATE:
The 2006 edition, component description above, was recently released."
1055,"Other than the use of color in the rules and the play aids, the only difference between this and the 2006 edition is I added some variant rules to the rulebook."
1055,This rulebook is available from GMT games as a free download.
1056,The LOOP is a quirky co-operative game in which you battle the evil Dr. Faux.
1056,"Play a Temporal Agent in four different game modes, full of new challenges and replay value."

1056,"With the help of the duplicates of himself that he is creating through the ages, he aims to carry out his Omniscience 2000 project to become master of the universe."

1058,Emperor Trajan plans to have a monument built for eternity: the Forum Trajanum.
1058,"It is supposed to become the biggest and most glorious Emperor's forum that the Roman world has ever seen — not only in order to demonstrate his success as Princeps Optimus in an imposing manner, but also to foster the well-being and the fame of the honorable citizens of Rome."
1058,"In Forum Trajanum, each player governs a Colonia, founded by Trajan himself, and thus is the head of one of the highest-ranking cities in the entire Roman Empire."
1058,"While the players try to optimally develop their own Colonia, they should not fail in supporting the Emperor's building project to the best of their abilities at the same time."
1058,The player who is most successful in doing so will — after expiry of their term of office — be admitted to the small circle of illustrious and mighty personalities surrounding the Emperor.
1059,"In Vanuatu, you are a Vanuatuan who wants to prosper during the eight turns of the game."
1059,"In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists."
1059,"To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries."
1059,"On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens."
1059,"You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space."
1059,"Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions."
1059,"If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action."
1059,"A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first – order matters!"
1059,"Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!"
1059,There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan.
1059,"When you reach ten vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor."
1059,"Life is hard, but you may encounter ten men to help you; on each turn you choose one of them to increase your benefits from an action."
1059,"As always, being the first player lets you choose before the others."
1059,"In short, Vanuatu is a strategy game of programming and majorities that features development, blocking, and a lot of interaction between players."
1059,(*) Sand Drawing in Vanuatu belongs to the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO.
1060,The general theme and mechanics of Caylus Magna Carta are similar to the Caylus board game.
1060,"However, there is no board or score track and the tactical nuts and bolts of the game are somewhat different."
1060,"In terms of components, the game consists of cards, money, worker pawns, resource markers, the provost, and castle building stones."
1060,"Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck."
1060,"Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:

extend the road by building a new building 
pay 1 to draw a new building card 
pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted) 
pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards 
build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or 
pass

Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money)."
1060,Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color.
1060,"When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points."
1060,Players may also choose to help build the castle.
1060,"Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones."
1060,The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points).
1060,Players collect the most valuable ones first.
1060,"In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker."
1060,"From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle."
1060,The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished.
1060,"Victory points are awarded for castle stones, cards built, and resources and money in hand at the end of the game."
1061,Power Grid: Factory Manager is the new stand-alone game in the world of Power Grid.
1061,"It was released at Spiel '09 in Essen, Germany."
1061,Each player owns a factory and tries to earn the most money during the game.
1061,"To be successful, each player must use his workers to buy the best machines and robots at the market and to run the machines most effectively in his factory."
1061,"Because of increasing energy prices, the players must be careful to check the energy consumption of their factories and to avoid using only energy-consuming machines."
1061,"Otherwise, their profit will suddenly vanish, the worst fear of a good businessperson."
1061,Power Grid: Factory Manager uses a clever market mechanism for choosing the supply of factory tiles in the market.
1062,"Description from the publisher:
With the driving of the golden spike in 1869, the first transcontinental railroad was completed in the United States — but really it was only the beginning of a rapid expansion of railways that would crisscross the entire country."
1062,"In Whistle Stop, you make your way west across the country, using your fledgling railroad company to build routes, pick up valuable cargo, and deliver needed goods to growing towns, creating a network of whistle stops that you and your competitors can leverage as you continue to expand your networks."
1062,"Along the way, you gain shares in other railroads and watch your reputation soar with each successful delivery before making a final push to complete long hauls to the boom towns of the West."
1062,This design is a new twist on pick-up-and-deliver games.
1062,"As players move their trains west and pick up goods, they can deliver those goods to small towns to gain shares in railroads, or hold on to them for a bigger payout when they reach the west coast."
1062,"At the same time, they try to optimize their actions (and gain extra ones), lay down new track tiles, block the other players, gather and use valuable whistles for special moves and abilities, and carefully manage their coal resources."
1063,"The great Sapa Inca Pachacuti turned to his offspring and ordered them to worship Inti, the Sun God, and to expand the Inca Empire as far as the llamas roam."
1063,"With Chinchaysuyu, Antisuyu, Qullasuyu, and Kuntisuyu — the four regions of the new empire — now ripe for conquest, the time has come for Pachacuti's true successor to arise."
1063,Gather your people from the villages below and use their unique abilities to strategically place them where they can perform the greatest tasks for you.
1063,"Climb the steps of the Sun Temple, reaping the rewards of your piety."
1063,Build structures that both nourish your people and provide you with benefits no other has at their disposal.
1063,Muster an army and conquer villages in the four realms of Tawantinsuyu.
1063,Prove yourself a worthy successor to Pachacuti and lead the Inca to glory!
1063,"During Tawantinsuyu: The Inca Empire, players place workers onto various locations on the game board, performing actions, collecting resources (potatoes, corn, stone, and gold), constructing buildings and stairs, sculpt statues, expanding their military strength, and collecting weavings."
1063,"The game board features a hill located within the old Inca capital of Cusco, the sides of which are terraced and divided into five sections."
1063,"Atop the hill sits the Coricancha, The Golden Temple, the most important temple of the Inca Empire."
1063,"Within the Coricancha, each player has a High Priest."
1063,"On the terraced sections below exist a variety of worker placement locations, interconnected by paths and individually marked by symbols."
1063,"On your turn, you must either place a worker onto a location outside the Coricancha OR choose two of the following:

 Recruit one worker."
1063,Take two god cards.
1063,Draw two army cards and keep one of them.
1063,Move your High Priest one or two steps clockwise within the Coricancha.
1063,"When placing a worker, you must first discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay one gold."
1063,"Once placed, the worker remains on the game board for the rest of the game!"
1063,Each worker placement location is connected to exactly three action spaces.
1063,You must always perform at least one of these actions.
1063,"However, for each adjacent worker (i.e., connected to your worker's location via direct path through one of the action spaces) that matches the type of worker just placed, you receive one additional action!"
1063,"While some locations will result in you being able to perform multiple actions, other actions and placements may be more desirable, especially since each of the five types of workers has a unique ability:

 Warrior: Remove one of the adjacent workers, placing it in your player area."
1063,Craftsman: Gain +1 action if placed onto a craftsman space.
1063,Architect: Gain +1 action if placed onto an architect space.
1063,Courier: Decreased placement cost; +1 action if it's the first worker placed within a given area.
1063,Priest: Take one god card; you may pay one potato to gain +1 action.
1063,All god cards feature one of the different symbols found on the worker placement locations.
1063,"Before placing a worker, you must either discard a god card with a matching symbol or pay valuable gold resources."
1063,God cards also depict special abilities that can be activated only if you have previously built a matching statue!
1063,Army cards allow you to send one or more units to conquer villages in nearby regions.
1063,You must compete against the other players for control of each region as well as for valuable rewards that can be gained as a result of military conquest.
1063,"The position of your High Priest within the Coricancha has a significant impact on your overall strategy, affecting your access to powerful actions and determining any potential resource costs when placing your workers."
1063,"More specifically, when placing a worker, you must pay additional resources the farther your worker is from your High Priest, from nothing all the way up to eight potatoes or corn!"
1063,"Additionally, when moving your High Priest, you can activate powerful actions available only within the Coricancha:

 Produce: Gain all rewards from your production buildings."
1063,Worship: Sacrifice previously sculpted statues to gain permanent temple advancements.
1063,Offering: Pay resources to gain temple advancements.
1063,Conquer: Engage in military conquest of nearby villages.
1063,Rejuvenate: Refresh previously activated buildings and military units.
1063,"Throughout the game, you score victory points whenever you construct stairs or sculpt statues."
1063,Gain bonus victory points whenever another player makes use of the stairs you have constructed.
1063,Score victory points from temple advancements and control of the four regions.
1063,"The game ends when the worker pool has become exhausted, symbolizing the full incorporation of nearby regions and villages into the newly risen Inca Empire."
1063,"You then score bonus victory points from reaching the top of the temple, from your woven tapestries, and from various buildings and resources you have accumulated."

1064,"Every day, dozens of birds have a stop on the fences of our countryside."
1064,"When it is time to leave, all these birds mix together, unable to organize themselves into flocks to fly home."
1064,Help them find their way back to their nest.
1064,Players begin each new round of CuBirds with eight bird cards in hand.
1064,Some birds also sit on four distinct fences on the table.
1064,"On your turn, you lay a series of identical birds from your hand on one fence's extremity."
1064,"These birds instantly gather with any identical bird already present on this fence, making all birds placed in-between them fly into your hand."
1064,"With enough identical birds in your hand, you can perform a flock, allowing you to add some of these birds in your scoring area."
1064,"Your ultimate goal is to be the first player to gather in your scoring area either seven different species, or two species with at least three identical birds in each."
1064,"Each bird comes with one small and one big flock scores, so you may want to wait to reach a big flock to add more birds at once to your scoring area."
1064,"Beware, though, as the round ends as soon as a player empties their hand, forcing all players to discard their current hands and plans!"
1065,Do we really have free will?
1065,Who decides this?
1065,"Are we controlled by what we hear and what we see, even while thinking we decide freely?"
1065,Insider is a game that deals with these questions.
1065,"While communicating to others, you have to find the right answers to a quiz or find the ""insider"" who is manipulating the discussion."
1065,The insider will do everything to hide their identity while misleading the others.
1065,"In more detail, players are assigned roles at random."
1065,"One player is the ""master"", and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of cards."
1065,"(In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write down a word.)"
1065,"The ""insider"" player, whose role is not known to the other players, will then secretly view the word."
1065,"The rest of the players are known as ""commons""."
1065,"The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master ""yes"" or ""no""-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word."
1065,The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the correct word.
1065,"If the commons fail to guess the correct word, everyone loses."
1065,"If, however, the word is correctly guessed in the allowable time, the master flips the sand timer, and the commons and master have until the sand runs out to discuss the game and deduce the identity of the insider."
1065,"If they guess correctly, they win the game together; if they do not, the insider wins."
1066,"In Primordial Soup each player controls a species of primitive ""amoeboid"" organisms."
1066,Together these species form an ecosystem where each feeds on the excreta of the others.
1066,To win a player must guide the evolution of their species to increase their population and the sophistication of their genes.
1066,Each round consists of various phases.
1066,Firstly each organism must move (either by drifting or under its own power) and then feed.
1066,Then the environment undergoes a random change which changes the direction of drift and may force some organisms to give up genes.
1066,"Then the species may buy new genes, and then may reproduce."
1066,At this point some organisms will die and finally each species is scored.
1066,This is repeated until either a species gets at least 42 points or the environment cards are exhausted.
1066,"The possible genes include genes for enhanced control of movement, more efficient metabolism, more efficient reproduction, attack and defence."
1066,"Expanded by:

Primordial Soup: Freshly Spiced"
1067,Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy.
1067,"Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes."
1067,"Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples."
1067,"These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses."
1067,"Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici."
1067,Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile.
1067,"Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income."
1067,"These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game."
1067,A city's status will change as a result of war.
1067,"When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them."
1067,"Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city."
1067,The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army.
1067,"Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is."
1067,"Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles."
1067,No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery.
1067,"Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction."
1067,"However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal."
1067,"Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting."
1067,"Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight."
1067,"At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e."
1067,join one side in a battle).
1067,"Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him?"
1067,What players negotiate over is up to them.
1067,"The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore."
1068,"Game description from the publisher:
LEVEL 7 [Omega Protocol] picks up right where LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE] left off."
1068,"The Subterra Bravo facility has been thrown into chaos through the players actions in [ESCAPE], and now the government has sent in a top-secret, highly-trained special forces unit to shut down the facility and eliminate everything remaining in the base."
1068,"In [Omega Protocol], one player takes on the role of the Overseer while two to five other players take on the role of the elite Special Ops team."
1068,The Overseer's role in the game is to control all of the alien denizens and challenges the players face throughout the game.
1068,The players are trying to achieve specific scenario-based objectives by exploring a map that's laid out at the start and fighting off the hordes of aliens that the Overseer sends their way.
1068,"Gameplay is based around adrenaline, which is the currency that the soldier players use to perform actions."
1068,"They generate adrenaline to do things such as move, attack, and perform special actions like activating an objective space."
1068,"That generation also has a negative effect for them, as that adrenaline transfers to the Overseer player, who then uses it to spawn aliens, create new threats, and hurt the soldiers' chance of success during the scenario."
1068,"The more actions the Special Ops players take, the more resources the Overseer player has to work with."
1068,"Characters in [Omega Protocol] are represented by miniatures, and each Special Ops and alien character has different attributes, powers, and customizable skills and equipment."
1069,"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series."
1069,"There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold."
1069,"Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card."
1069,"In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them."
1069,"There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game."
1069,With each new village or city comes two new resource cards.
1069,Villages and cities give victory points.
1069,"When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge."
1069,"There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:

 a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),
 a bonus resource,
 an attack if a player has too many resources, and
 one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress."
1069,There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table.
1069,"Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands."
1069,"Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights."
1069,Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both.
1069,Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other.
1069,"After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement."
1069,Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns.
1069,"Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points."
1069,Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!

1073,"Golem is an engine-building game by Simone Luciani, Virginio Gigli and Flaminia Brasini, the same team that brought you Grand Austria Hotel and Lorenzo il Magnifico."
1073,"The game is based on the 16th-century legend of the Golem of Prague, an anthropomorphic creature that Rabbi Loew animated from a clay statue to protect his people."
1073,"In the game, players take on the role of rabbis who create and grow these powerful creatures that will be moved around the neighborhoods of Prague under the control of students."
1073,"Be careful, because if a golem becomes too powerful, it will destroy everything it encounters on its way."
1073,Players can also kill their Golems in order to get bonuses.
1073,Players also create powerful artifacts and acquire knowledge by collecting ancient books.
1073,"The game is divided into four rounds, and each round is composed of 7 phases:
1) Refresh
2) Golem Movement
3) Actions (2 marble actions and 1 rabbi action)
4) Turn Order
5) Influence Character
6) Income and Development
7) Golem Control
At the beginning of each round, the players will shuffle the colored marbles into the 3D synagogue that will split them into five lines corresponding to the five main actions available in the game:

 Work: By paying Knowledge, you can activate the Golem placed in the city of Prague and get bonuses."
1073,Golem: Obtain clay to create new golems and upgrade the developments on your personal board.
1073,Artifact: Obtain coins and buy gold to build artifacts that offer permanent bonuses in the game and upgrade developments on your personal board.
1073,Spells: Obtain Knowledge and perform spells (with a scoring for book collection) and upgrade developments on your personal board.
1073,Mirror: Perform one action of your choice by paying 1 coin.
1073,The number of marbles available in the corresponding action line determines how much the player gets from the action.
1073,"When you choose an action, you collect one marble of your choice in the corresponding line and depending on the color of the marble you chose, you also move your student forward on one of the districts of Prague."
1073,It's important to advance your students on those tracks to be able to keep your golems under control.
1073,"At the end of the round, knowledge can also be used to control a golem that surpassed its students, but if one of these creatures is uncontrolled, it may become dangerous and destroy the neighborhood, after which you will have to destroy and bury it!"
1073,"The marble color also matters, because at the end of the round, if you get the correct combination of two colors, you receive the favor of one of the powerful Prague characters, which will differ each round."
1073,"At the end of the fourth round, players score points for active or buried golems, artifacts, books, development on their personal board, and collected goal cards."

1074,"One player controls a small group of determined humans, while the other plays an almost unending army of demonic creatures."
1074,"The game is thematic and highly asymmetric: human characters are stronger, but the demon characters are more numerous."
1074,"Gameplay is very straightforward with a minimum of rules, and each game plays in an hour or less."
1074,"In essence dice are allocated after rolling to perform actions, while cards or special abilities are also available."
1074,"The game is about managing decisions and choosing what to do with the resources that you have, managing difficult events and out-thinking your opponent."
1074,Combat is handled by dice.

1075,"Plague Inc: The Board Game is a strategic game of infection, evolution and extinction for 1-5* people - based on the smash-hit digital game with over 85 million players."
1075,Can you infect the world?
1075,"Each player is a deadly disease and they must battle against each other to spread their plagues, develop new symptoms and ultimately wipe out humanity."
1075,"Starting with Patient Zero, you spread your infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points and preventing other players from becoming dominant."
1075,Players choose which countries are placed on the board but you must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before you can infect it.
1075,"Eventually, as countries become fully infected - you try to kill them using the Death Dice."
1075,Each player’s unique pathogen can be upgraded by evolving trait cards onto an evolution slide (with DNA points).
1075,"At the start, your disease is weak and unspecialised, so you will need to add new symptoms to make it stronger."
1075,Choose carefully and plan ahead in order to react to the changing world and exploit opportunities created by other player’s actions.
1075,"A simple nosebleed could accelerate things early on, whilst diarrhea will help you thrive in hot countries."
1075,Sneezing can infect new continents by air but Total Organ Failure would allow you wipe out multiple countries each turn.
1075,"As countries start to fall, use powerful event cards to alter the balance of power."
1075,"You might try to eradicate a dominant player by bombing their diseased cities, or hold the Olympics to cause huge numbers of infected people to travel to a healthy continent."

1077,"You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them — and, of course, score points."
1077,The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile.
1077,"Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces."
1077,"On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display."
1077,"All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available."
1077,"Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card."
1077,"After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card."
1077,"Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp."
1077,"(If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.)"
1077,"If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points)."
1077,"Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal."
1077,You (and only you!)
1077,immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale.
1077,If you don't have an animal of that type you don't get any points.
1077,"Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game."
1077,The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game.
1077,"When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round."
1077,Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.
1078,"In Encore!, first published as Noch mal!, the dice determine which color and how many spaces you can mark off on your playing sheet — but the starting player may first evaluate what everyone's doing, then remove two dice, leaving everyone else to make their choices with the dice that remain..."
1079,"In Bullet♥︎, players take on the role of heroines in a far-flung future Earth and use their incredible powers to defend the Earth from evil — as well as from one another!"
1079,"Each heroine's powers manifest in a different form, with players controlling sound, paper, technology, gravity, triangles, and more!"
1079,Turns are simultaneous.
1079,"Place bullets in your sight, with the color of bullet determining the column and the number how far down in that column it is placed."
1079,Use actions to manipulate bullets to form configurations matching your patterns.
1079,Using a pattern removes bullets from your sight and sends them to the opponent.
1079,"When placing bullets, you skip over existing bullets in the column you place it in, with the bullet hitting you if it is placed off your sight."
1079,"At the end of the turn, you'll gain even more bullets from the center bag as well as what the opponent sent, ensuring each new turn is more hectic than the last!"
1079,"Choosing what order to place bullets, use actions, and use patterns in is key to staying alive as long as possible!"
1079,Playing with the optional timer makes for even more intense play!
1079,"Bullet♥︎ includes eight heroines to play and four game modes:

Battle Royale Mode: 2–4 players can duel in a free-for-all puzzle battle that plays in real-time!"

1104,At the end of the four rounds there are 12 cards in front of each player.

1106,Included in this game are 4 unique 60 minute escape room puzzles that will test your cranial skills.
1106,"Use images, gears, words, keys, shapes, maps and more to solve the three stages within each escape room."
1106,"An analog timer on the Chrono Decoder centerpiece incessantly counts down, emitting ominous noises to create an environment shut out from the outside world."
1106,"If the puzzles stump you for too long, slide a hint card into the Hint Decoder to keep your team moving."
1106,"Slide 4 keys into the Chrono Decoder when you think you have the answer... but beware, if you're wrong, a precious minute will be taken from you."
1106,"The 4 escape rooms vary in difficulty, designed to give any group the experience they expect and deserve."

1107,"Colossal Arena/Titan:The Arena is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!"
1107,Each round one of the creatures will die.
1107,"To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard."
1107,The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!
1107,The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.
1107,"Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but The Avalon Hill Game Co's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint."
1107,"The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan."
1107,"But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two."
1107,Reimplemented by: Galaxy: The Dark Ages
1108,"In Augustus, you vie with your fellow players to complete ""objective"" cards for special powers and ultimately for victory points."
1108,Each card has 2-6 symbols which you must populate with legionnaire meeples in order to complete the card.
1108,"These symbols are drawn one at a time from a bag, with all players gaining the benefit equally, but interestingly, the bag contains more of some symbols than others."
1108,So the pivotal skill you'll deploy is in making your choice of which three objectives you'll start the game with (you're dealt six) — balancing potential difficulty of completion against value of the reward — and then which of five available objectives you'll add to your plate each time you complete one of your three.
1108,The game ends when someone completes seven objectives.

1110,"Five years later, a government project called ""Street Masters"" initiates in order to counter-act the war against The Kingdom, now having divided and seized control over the world by several of its factions."

1111,"Survivors begin the game on the edge of an unexplored landscape, uncertain of what awaits them in this unfamiliar world."
1111,"With just one objective to guide them from the very beginning, each player must explore the hidden map, fight ferocious enemies, and build the skills of their survivor as they attempt to complete challenging quests and balance feuding factions within the game."
1111,"As they advance their survivors' stories, players come across new quests and individual targets, leading them to gain influence."
1111,"Who comes out ahead depends on how keenly and aggressively each player ventures through the game; however, if a single faction is pushed to power too quickly, the wasteland will be taken for their own, and the survivors conquered along with it."
1111,—description from the publisher
1112,"In 12th century Japan, the Minamoto and Taira clans vie for power while retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa plays his rivals against one another."
1112,One of the three factions will triumph to impose the coming social order.
1112,"In the shadow of these elite powers, a few ninja scheme to exploit the chaos."
1112,"Daring raids, skill mastery, and subtle intrigue are essential to establishing one’s honor."
1112,"When the new era dawns, one ninja will flourish as the Ninjato, the Invisible Sword of the ruling family."
1113,"Players in The Game try to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways."
1113,"Each player starts with 6-8 cards in their hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing ""1"" and an up arrow and two showing ""100"" and a down arrow."
1113,"On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order."
1113,"One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97."
1113,"After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck."
1113,"During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions."
1113,"Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn."
1113,"If you play all 98 cards, you win!"
1113,"If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge."
1114,"The Empire, formed by three Kingdoms, lives in an era of wealth and prosperity."
1114,Each Kingdom is governed by a council of four nobles.
1114,The members of six influential families sit around in the councils and lead the Kingdoms.
1114,The players hold the roles of rich merchants who seek to obtain permits to build their own Emporium inside the cities of the three Kingdoms.
1114,"Whoever takes more permits, while also opening their Emporium in the best place, will be the most famous merchant and will win the game."
1114,But pay attention to the Emperor!
1114,He can be your ally and allow you to build without permits!
1114,"On a turn, a player can perform different actions:
- The main action is to corrupt a council, which is represented by a slide with four pawns representing four nobles."
1114,"By corrupting the three councilors of the three Kingdoms, the player gets permit cards that give various instant and endgame benefits, and the possibility to build an Emporium in a specific city."
1114,- Another action is to play a permission card to build an Emporium.
1114,"Each Emporium earns the player the special benefits of the space where it's built, but also activates all connected emporiums in a chain effect."
1114,- Corrupt the Emperor’s council to allow a player to build Emporiums without permission cards.
1114,- Players can change the composition of a council.
1114,"There are many different ways to earn points:
- Build a connected Emporium in the cities that award points."
1114,"- Build your emporium in all the cities of an area of the board: the faster you complete the area, the more points you earn."
1114,- Move up on the nobility’s track.
1114,Obtain permits that give points.
1114,"Moreover, the board is modular and has eight possible combinations."
1115,"Designed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build."
1115,Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra’s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.
1115,"Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster."
1115,"While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price – cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god."
1115,"When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile!"
1115,"Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game."
1115,"“The component design in Cleopatra is the most innovative we’ve undertaken to date,” said Days of Wonder CEO, Eric Hautemont."
1115,"“While it’s still a board game, the dozens of 3D pieces – Column walls, Doorframes, Obelisks, Sphinxes, and Palace Throne – all create the sense that you’re constructing a royal palace.”
“The game play really forces players into continually weighing the risks and rewards between taking enough corruption to enhance your position in the game, but not so much that you are forced out of the game at the end,” said the game’s co-designer, Bruno Cathala."
1115,"“It’s a classic ‘push your luck’ dilemma that continually raises the tension level higher and higher until the game reaches its climax.”

1116,Competitive free-for-all with game controlled Zombies.
1116,Competitive free-for-all with Zombies controlled by a player.
1116,Solo.
1116,THEME: Modern day Zombie outbreak at the Echo Ridge Mall.
1116,"HOOK: Fast paced, portable, and tons of replayability."
1116,Play as the survivors or the Zombies.
1116,Plus ITEMeeples!
1116,WIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.
1116,"OVERVIEW: In Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives."
1116,"Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you."
1116,"Based on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies."
1116,"As a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times."
1116,"Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things."
1116,"For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die."
1116,"Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it."
1116,Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming.
1116,"Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!"
1116,"After you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room."
1116,This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding.
1116,"Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples."
1116,"Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner."
1116,So be prepared.
1116,"After you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall."
1116,Then it's the next player's turn.
1116,Simple as that.
1116,"Note: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat!"
1116,"So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high."
1116,"If you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play."
1116,"If that happens too many times, you lose the game."
1116,"As a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies!"
1116,"With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains."
1116,Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies.
1116,Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives.
1116,"If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win."
1117,"GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: In turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row."
1117,Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row.
1117,This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board.
1117,"The purpose is to form successive rows of at least four pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play."
1117,"GIPF is not only the name of a game, but of a project as well."
1117,This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step.
1117,"Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF."
1117,It concerns a system that makes winning or losing GIPF-related games a strategic factor of the game GIPF itself.
1117,This game is part of project GIPF.
1118,Escape from the Aliens in Outer Space is a card game of strategy and bluff set on a badly damaged deep space research ship.
1118,"On-board systems have failed, plunging the ship into darkness."
1118,But even worse: A mysterious alien plague has crept aboard and is transforming the human crew into horrendous monsters!
1118,"The remaining crewmen desperately try to save their lives by escaping from the derelict spaceship, but in the darkness the aliens are lurking...hungry for human flesh."
1118,The game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship.
1118,Each player is given a map sheet and a pencil.
1118,"Map sheets must be of the same zone, and every zone has its specific name."
1118,"Starting from the first player and continuing clockwise, every turn, each player must make a movement."
1118,"To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving."
1118,"Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card."
1118,Every card is kept secret from other players.
1118,"The humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans."
1118,Each player's identity and position is kept secret; you will need to interpret the movements and behaviors of the other players to learn who and where they really are.
1119,"In the trick-taking card game Stick 'Em, first released as Sticheln, players seek to gather points each hand by taking as many cards as possible of all but one color, while trying to avoid cards of one color of their choosing."
1119,"In more detail, at the beginning of each hand, each player simultaneously selects and reveals one card from their hand, with the color of this card representing their ""pain"" color."
1119,"At the end of the hand, each card of this color that they've collected (including their initial choice from their hand) is worth negative points equal to the card's face value."
1119,Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.
1119,"To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card."
1119,"If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick."
1119,(One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.)
1119,"In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins."
1119,"In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie."
1119,"Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner."
1119,"Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players."
1119,"(These versions also allow players to play the game Hattrick by the same designer, with rules for this game included as a variant.)"
1120,Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you in the cockpits of the world’s best Close Air Support aircraft.
1120,"In Thunderbolt-Apache Leader, you’ll zoom through canyons hunting enemy tanks and troops while dodging their AAA fire and SAMs."
1120,Stuffing all this heavy metal in one box has allowed us to expand the normal Leader component set!
1120,This game comes with 168 cards and 5 counter sheets!
1120,Thunderbolt-Apache Leader puts you down in the weeds in 8 campaigns spanning the globe.
1120,The game system creates immense replayability by pairing a Tactical Situation card with the Campaign card to create a unique environment for the campaign.
1120,"This means that your campaign in North Korea might be part of a Holding Action, Show of Force, Rapid Deployment, or General War."
1120,The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world.
1120,The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.
1120,A major part of the game is mission planning.
1120,You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission.
1120,Pilots are rated for skill level.
1120,Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration.
1120,Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission.
1120,"If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade."
1120,Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown.
1120,This makes for some great decision-making.
1120,"Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?"
1120,Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target.
1120,Speed and realism take top priority in this game.
1120,Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield.
1120,The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces.
1120,"If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridge-line to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react."
1120,Beware!
1120,"During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you’re flying!"
1120,"You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets."
1120,"Each enemy tank, S.P."
1120,"Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield."
1120,"You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft."
1120,"While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites."
1120,This makes for some tough choices.
1120,"Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?"
1120,Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack.
1120,These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage.
1120,This also factors into your decision-making.
1120,How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home?
1120,"If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won’t be able to fly the next day."
1120,Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector.
1120,You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.
1120,"If you’ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you’ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader."
1120,"We’ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!"
1120,"Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:

1123,Strasbourg in the 15th century - the political skills of the city are heavily influenced by the craftsmen guilds .
1123,"In this time, players take on the lead of ascending families of the city."
1123,It is your goal to place your family members in the different guilds.
1123,"Only the clever usage of influence points makes it possible to be accommodated as apprentice, assistant or even master craftsman - provided you can pay the admission fee."
1123,But don't underestimate the power of the church or the nobility.
1123,"Strasbourg is a easy to learn strategy game with inventive mechanisms, that provide the player with lots of room for decisions."
1123,But only those that also keep an eye on the plans of the other players will earn the highest fame in the end.

1124,"Through auctions in each of the 8 rounds, the players develop their civilizations, adding territory through Land Tiles and prestigious buildings through the Building Tiles."
1124,"These increase the civilizations' inhabitants, luxury, wealth and power."
1124,"Luxury goods allow flexibility in providing for a player's population, while some tiles also offer protection against the many disasters that happen during the game."

1149,"In addition to these resources, glaciers have been discovered on the planet."
1149,"Whoever controls these icy masses could work to create a livable atmosphere on Mars
In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials."
1149,"Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same."
1149,"Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice."
1149,"After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts."
1149,"At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards."

1149,"From Bruno Faidutti's website:
This one, designed with Bruno Cathala, started with the theme."
1149,"We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one."
1149,"The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmodée."
1149,"In Mission: Red Planet, each player plays a colonial power which sends astronauts, in space shuttles, to occupy the most promising zones on the planet."
1149,"For scholars, the systems merge a majority game, à la El Grande or San Marco, with a character/action card system, somewhere between Citadels and Hoity Toity/Adel Verpflichtet."
1149,"Nothing really new here, but there was much work on it and we're really proud of the result."
1150,"Welcome to Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba, home of legendary rum and birthplace of the revolution!"
1150,The chaotic streets hum with the sounds of bustling crowds and busy commerce.
1150,Cargo ships constantly arrive and depart from the port.
1150,"Demand is continuous, if unpredictable, for a supply of local products such as exotic fruits, sugar, rum, tobacco, and cigars."
1150,"In Santiago de Cuba, your business card says ""broker"", but in reality you're a shady wheeler-dealer who arranges deals with the locals and with corruptible officials to move goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships – and your ability to procure these goods is only as reliable as your ""connections""."
1150,"At the start of the game, nine locals – the Cubans – are randomly arranged on a path around Santiago, with the port being the tenth location on the circuit."
1150,"Each Cuban has a different ability: e.g., give a player two tobacco, give a player a good of his choice, force opponents to give you something, give money or victory points (VPs), and seize a building or allow a player to use a previously seized building."
1150,What are these buildings?
1150,"At the start of the game, twelve buildings are randomly placed on the game board in four color-coded groups (white, yellow, etc.)"
1150,of three.
1150,"As with the Cubans, these buildings give players a special ability when used: convert tobacco to cigars, change VPs to money or vica versa, increase the value of goods delivered to the ship, render a Cuban inactive for the next round, and so on."
1150,Players will deliver goods to seven ships throughout the course of the game.
1150,The demand for each ship is determined via a die roll; the active player rolls five dice – one for each type of good – then chooses four of the values rolled to represent demand for goods of the same color as the die.
1150,All players share a car and travel around the island together.
1150,"On a turn, the active player can move the car to the next location on the path (whether Cuban or port) for free, or pay one peso for each spot moved beyond that."
1150,"After taking a Cuban action, the player then must move his player piece to a building of the same color as the flower on that Cuban."
1150,"If he takes an action in a building owned by someone else, that player earns 1 VP."
1150,(One Cuban allows a player to use the same building where his piece is currently located.)
1150,"If a player moves to port, players take turns delivering all goods of one type to the ship to meet demand, adjusting the demand dice as needed."
1150,A player earns 2-4 VP for each good delivered; a player doesn't have to deliver goods.
1150,"If the ship's demand isn't met after everyone delivers or passes, the VP bounty per good is increased by one and the ship remains in place – unless the value was already at 4 VP, in which case the ship sails."
1150,"In this case, or when all the demand is met, a new ship comes into port with new demand values."
1150,"After seven ships have sailed, the players earn 1 VP for every three goods still on hand, then tally their VPs."
1150,"The player with the most VPs wins, with ties broken by goods remaining, then money."
1150,"Each game poses new tactical challenges for the players, thanks to ever-changing combinations of buildings, Cuban inhabitants and demand for goods."
1151,Java is a fascinating island with great potential for development — especially the undeveloped area of central Java with its fertile soil and rich natural resources.
1151,These riches are much desired by the rulers of the regions that surround central Java.
1151,"Each player, as one of the Javanese rulers, tries to develop the region for themselves."
1151,Each wants to bring their culture and control to these undeveloped areas.
1151,"The players irrigate the land and cultivate new rice fields; they build villages and palaces, and create cities from the villages."
1151,Each player desires to be the dominant force in the development of this new area.
1151,"Players earn fame points for building and enlarging palaces, for creating irrigation systems, and for arranging palace festivals."
1151,The player with the most fame points after the final scoring wins.
1151,Java is the second game of the Mask Trilogy.
1152,This entry is for the Living Card Game (LCG) that was developed from the Collectible Card Game (CCG).
1152,"For the CCG, go to A Game of Thrones CCG
This is no longer a CCG, having transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format."
1152,"Excerpts from FFG's ""LCG: A Player's Guide"":

""A Living Card Game (LCG) is a game that breaks away from the traditional Collectible Card Game (CCG) model by offering a new fixed card distribution method that still offers the same dynamic customizable, expanding, and constantly evolving game play that makes CCG’s so much fun, but without the blind buy purchase model that has burned out so many players."
1152,The end result is an innovative mix that gives you the best of both worlds!
1152,....
1152,The first phase is the release of a LCG Core Set.
1152,"Every LCG will have an amazing, high quality and widely available entry point packed with content, including high-quality game pieces and immersive game aides to enhance the game."
1152,"Core Sets are completely self-contained, with multiple decks included, providing a great game experience right out of the box."
1152,"The Core Sets are followed by monthly installments of expansion packs, each a set of forty fixed cards, providing an ongoing and regular addition to the available card pool."
1152,"These expansion packs add customization, variety, and an ongoing “story” to everyone’s experience with the Core Game."""
1152,"Starting with the Brotherhood Without Banners cycle, expansion packs come in sets of 60 fixed cards - 3 copies of 20 unique cards."
1152,Starting in November 2011 Fantasy Flight is going to reprint the King's Landing and Defenders of the North Packs to the new 60 card format.

1153,"Description from the publisher:
The next great technological revolution is here."
1153,"Sentient robots for information, transportation, industry — all at our fingertips."
1153,Building them is now the easy part.
1153,Programming them has proven to be more complicated.
1153,"A handful of companies have emerged claiming to pull it off, but only one will win out."
1153,Your mission is clear: Procure valuable bots and plug them into your network.
1153,They'll have an effect on your systems.
1153,"Anticipate it correctly, program your bots effectively, and attract the right investors to win and lead the sentient revolution."
1153,"In Sentient, players are tasked with choosing from available robots to program in their factory."
1153,Each robot that is added modifies your board and attracts the interest of investors for your company.
1153,Program your bots efficiently and collect the support of your patrons to build the most formidable operation.
1153,"Description from GTS article:
Sentient is a dice-manipulation game by J. Alex Kevern (World’s Fair 1893, Gold West)."
1153,"As with his other games, Sentient is filled with smart, simple, and rewarding choices."
1153,"Each turn involves choosing an available bot, adding it to your factory, and deciding how to divide your resources between optimizing your bot and wooing investors."
1153,Players who enjoy a satisfying puzzle will appreciate the difficulty in adding the chosen bot to their factory.
1153,Each slot has a die on either side that will be modified based on the chosen bot card.
1153,"But, adding another adjacent bot the next turn will modify the dice once again."
1153,The dice at the end of the round will determine how efficiently your bots were programmed and will grant you varying points based on the dice numbers.
1153,"You may have everything perfectly sorted out — that is, until the last bot you choose changes the adjacent dice."
1153,Your plan can crumble and points can easily be lost with an errant decision or wrong choice!
1154,"As in its parent game Kakerlakenpoker, Kakerlakenpoker Royal has nothing to do with poker – except that the game is all about bluffing, but with cards showing cockroaches, rats and stink bugs instead of queens, 10s and aces."
1154,"To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players."
1154,"On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., ""Stink bug""."
1154,"The player receiving the card either:

Accepts the card, says either ""true"" or ""false"", then reveals the card."
1154,"If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him."
1154,"Passes the card to another player, peeking at it first, then keeping it face-down and either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type."
1154,"This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must accept it and make a true/false claim."
1154,The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him.
1154,"In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins."
1154,"To this, Kakerlakenpoker Royal adds new rules and new nasty ""royal"" critters to create more options for players during the game."
1155,"In ancient prehistoric times, you have discovered a new land with plentiful lakes, mountains and forests (and apparently many stone rocks that shall be called dice)."
1155,Your people can develop new things like basketry or find oxen or simply GROW and conquer.
1155,"In Rise of Tribes, players control a tribal faction in prehistoric times looking to GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and LEAD their people."
1155,"The board is modular, composed of hexes in various terrain types."
1155,Each hex has a population limit.
1155,Players manage the number of tribe members they place on any one hex to either trigger or avoid conflict.
1155,"Each turn the active player rolls two dice, then selects two of the four actions to take -  GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and/or LEAD."
1155,Each action is resolved one action at a time.
1155,The power of each action taken depends on the die roll plus the last couple of dice placed onto the action board on the selected action by other players.
1155,"Once both actions are taken, the active player resolves any Conflicts."
1155,The final step of each turn is the time to build villages and complete goal cards.
1155,Victory is possible in a couple ways: gathering resources to build villages and/or completing development and achievement goal cards for your civilization.
1155,Villages (limited to 1 per hex) score 1 point for the tribe that built them at the start of that tribe's turn.
1155,Goal cards will score points immediately when completed.
1155,Every tribe's ambition is to score 15 points.
1155,The tribe to score 15 points first wins the game.
1155,"Solo mode, with the addition of Rise of Tribes: The Vul'Keth Invasion (required and sold separately), is a very challenging way to play Rise of Tribes."
1155,"Rise of Tribes - Microbadges

1156,Conspiracy: Abyss Universe is a card game set in the world of Abyss.
1156,"The card deck in the game consists of cards in five colors, with twelve of each color and cards numbered 0–6."
1156,"Each player in the game drafts cards and builds a reverse pyramid, starting with a row of five cards, then placing four cards in a row below that, then three under that, etc."
1156,"On a turn, you can draw 1–3 cards from the deck, choose one of those cards and add it to your current row, then place any remaining cards grouped by color near the deck; alternatively, you can pick up all the cards of a color next to the deck and add them to your current row."
1156,"As soon as the cards in your rows show two matching keys or three different keys, you take either the revealed location card or the top card of the location deck, and place it on the lattermost card with a key."
1156,Location cards increase the value of a card and sometimes have special powers.
1156,"Some cards feature pearls, and when you have as many or more pearls as whoever has the pearl majority card, you take this card from them."
1156,"The game ends as soon as someone finishes their pyramid, then all players score their points."
1156,"For each color, you score points equal to the largest valued card in your pyramid."
1156,"Additionally, for each color, you look at the largest grouping of cards in your pyramid and you score 3 points for each of those cards."
1156,Whoever held the pearl majority card at game's end scores 5 points for it.
1156,Whoever has the highest score wins.
1157,"A Keythedral is being built in the fields near Keytown, in the middle of the Keydom."
1157,The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields.
1157,"The Keythedral will be built in five stages, and each stage will require different building materials."
1157,"In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed."
1157,"Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine."
1157,"In the game, each player starts with five cottages."
1157,Each cottage houses a worker.
1157,"Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land."
1157,These resources are required for building the Keythedral.
1157,"Problems, however, are at hand."
1157,"Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed."
1157,"Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle."
1157,Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers.
1157,"However, the workers are quite partial to the odd tipple, and for a couple of barrels of wine, they can be persuaded to remove any one of the fences that a player has taken offense to!"
1157,Good luck in your endeavors to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time.
1157,Keythedral is Richard Breese's fourth game in the key series.
1158,Embark on a cooperative epic adventure that is Folklore the Affliction.
1158,"Find and destroy the source of the evil spreading its claws into the heart of the land, decimating its people and resources."
1158,Free the denizens from the scourge of vampirism and lycanthropy and expand your power and abilities.
1158,"Are you a survivor, or will you play as your ghost?"
1158,Will you fall to the bloodlust or the taint of lycanthropy yourself?
1158,"Folklore: The Affliction is an expandable ongoing horror RPG board game for 1-5 players that focuses on immersive storyline, strategic combat, character development and intense character customization elements."

1159,The board is composed of 8 rooms that can be moved and rotated by the players.
1159,"Each turn, a player is able to spend actions to move around the dungeon, pick up and use items, battle with the opponents team, or turn and move the rooms of the dungeon."

1163,But now the time has come.
1163,From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials.
1163,"To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts."
1163,"Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks."
1163,"By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam."
1163,These resources are important.
1163,You will need them to grow your steam empires.
1163,You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet.
1163,"Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is – like on earth – always in short supply on Steam."
1163,"To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command – but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy."

1166,Spicy is a bluffing card game for 2-6 players.
1166,"The cards are played face down, so you can cheat when you announce your card."
1166,"That said, this clever card game isn't just about bluffing for you can almost always play a card that is at least half right if you cleverly play your hand."
1166,"This means tactically deciding which card to use to get through: Do I play a ""Pepper 10"" or a color wild on a ""Wasabi 9"" and declare it a ""Wasabi 10""?"
1166,Or do I better pass because surely someone has noticed me thinking for so long now?
1166,"Spicy contains six game-variant cards, but even without these a high replayability is guaranteed."
1166,The cards are illustrated with forty separate pieces of art.
1166,"In addition, not only the game box sparkles in chic metallic gold, but also the card backs are adorned with a gold-colored finish."

1167,"In Hostage Negotiator there are multiple paths to victory, but the hostage taker has other plans."
1167,Will you try to calm him and get him to surrender?

1167,How many hostages will you save?
1167,These are many of the exciting decisions you will make in a game of Hostage Negotiator!

1170,The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.
1170,"The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement."
1170,"When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities."
1170,"Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game."
1170,"The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism."
1170,"With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading)."
1170,"They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines)."

1171,"Collect complete color sets of professions (all five colors of Trader, for instance), which you use to buy victory points (VP)."
1171,The first player to gain 20 VP on her turn wins.
1171,"In Guildhall, each profession grants you special abilities, and these abilities grow stronger the more of the set that you complete."
1171,"When you cash in the set for victory points, however, you lose the ability until you can build it up again."
1171,Which professions are worth risking VP to keep?
1172,Liberté covers the French Revolution from 1789 and the meeting of the Estates General to the Directory and Bonaparte’s coup d’état in 1799.
1172,The game is played in four turns.
1172,"In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government."
1172,"There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white)."
1172,The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.
1172,He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.
1172,"The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'."
1172,The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.
1172,"Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals."
1172,The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.
1172,The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.
1172,Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.
1172,"Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces."
1172,Normally the player with the most victory points will win.
1172,"However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome."
1172,"The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes."
1172,"The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces."
1172,"In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count."
1172,The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!
1172,It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.
1172,Do not despair!
1172,Once you have completed your first game you will realize that amongst the apparent chaos of the game there are many opportunities for long-term planning.

1173,"Each faction has a special power that affects play, and powers can be different in each phase!"
1173,"At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of followers of a faction wins that faction's vote, and whoever wins the vote of at least three factions wins the game!"
1174,"In Royals, players take on the roles of the great noble houses of the 17th century, fighting for supremacy in Europe at that time."
1174,"With the help of the right country cards, they occupy influential positions and obtain bonuses for this in the form of victory points."
1174,"The higher the rank of the title associated with the position, the more country cards required."
1174,Already-occupied positions can be contested by playing intrigue cards.
1174,"The game proceeds over three periods, with a scoring taking place after each of them."
1174,"During scoring, the players with the greatest influence in each of the four countries score victory points."

1178,"In Small World of Warcraft, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate everybody."
1178,"Small World of Warcraft is set on the fantasy world of Azeroth, where the races of the Alliance and the Horde — including Orcs, Dwarves, Trolls, and Worgen — clash in a world-consuming conflict."
1178,"In the game, players choose combinations of special powers and races from the Warcraft universe, such as Portal Mage Pandarens or Herbalist Goblins, and vie for control of Azeroth."
1178,"To help them achieve dominance, players will occupy legendary terrains and seek control of powerful artifacts."
1178,"However, all empires must eventually fall, so players need to be ready to put an overextended race into a state of ""decline"" and lead a new one to rule Azeroth."
1178,"In more detail, on each turn either you use the multiple tiles of your chosen fantasy race to (normally) occupy adjacent territories, possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race and let it go into decline."
1178,A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.
1178,"At the start of the game or after you go into decline, you choose a new race/power combination at the start of your turn, with the 16 races and 20 powers being paired randomly each game."
1178,"At the end of your turn, you score one coin for each territory your races occupy."
1178,You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time.
1178,Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy.
1178,"After the final round, the player with the most coins wins."
1179,Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.
1179,The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.
1179,A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.
1179,"To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons."
1179,"Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game."
1179,Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).
1179,The round proceeds in 2 stages.
1179,The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).
1179,These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.
1179,After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.
1179,Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.
1179,This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.
1179,Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.
1179,"Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot."
1179,These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.
1179,The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.
1179,"For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains)."
1179,If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).
1179,Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card).
1179,All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles.

1199,"Since it is a delta-v map, it offers a completely different view of the accessibility of the worlds that orbit Sol."
1199,"The cards and map have been expanded and produced in consultation with experts in the field, and the author himself is a former rocket scientist, and we can safely say this is the most accurate yet accessible game of space exploration/exploitation ever published."
1199,"Transition rules allow High Frontier to work as an independent 4th stage in the Bios:Earth trilogy (Bios: Genesis, Bios: Megafauna, and BIOS: Origins) about the evolution of life on our planet."

1200,Dead Man's Draw is a simple and strategic card game of risk and reward for 2 to 4 players.
1200,Players take turns drawing cards and combining their special abilities to plunder the most loot without busting their entire hands.
1200,The core of your turn in Dead Man’s Draw is all in the flip: pulling the top card off the deck and using its special ability.
1200,"Your turn isn’t over until you say it is, though."
1200,"You can keep pulling cards as long as you like – until you play a card of a suit already seen, at which point you lose everything."
1200,"Knowing when to stop and ""bank"" your cards is the biggest decision you make in Dead Man’s Draw, but being too timid lets braver opponents pass you up with bigger, more profitable turns."
1200,"The cards’ special abilities are key to success in Dead Man’s Draw, and they build off of each other."
1200,Each suit in DMD has an effect that the player can target when they flip a card of that suit.
1200,Anchor – Keep everything you drew before the Anchor even if you bust.
1200,Cannon – Destroy one card an opponent has previously banked.
1200,Chest – Double your haul by banking as many cards directly from the discard pile as are in the river when you bank the Chest – but only if you also bank a Key.
1200,Hook – Play one of your previously banked cards.
1200,Key – Enables the Chest special.
1200,Kraken – Oh no!
1200,You’re forced to draw at least two more cards.
1200,Map – Draw three cards from the discard pile and play one.
1200,"Mermaid – No ability, but worth more points (Mermaids are numbered 4-9 instead of 2-7)."
1200,Oracle – Look at the next card before deciding if you want to play it.
1200,Sword – Steal an opponent’s previously banked card and play it.
1200,"Many of these work well together, like using a Hook to re-play a Sword from your hand to steal an opponent’s Chest to go with your Key – racking up huge points by playing abilities well and not solely through the luck of the draw."
1200,"As soon as the deck is depleted, players total up the value of the highest card they’ve banked from each suit."
1200,High score wins.
1201,"Build a better future underground in Fallout Shelter: The Board Game, a post-nuclear worker-placement board game for two to four players."

1201,"As an officer, you'll have to direct your dwellers to where they'll spend their time in the vault, whether it's spending some time relaxing in the lounge, gathering vital resources like food in the community gardens, or battling a radroach infestation in the game room."
1201,"The choice is always yours, but remember, you'll have to balance happiness and efficiency to lead your people to a brighter future underground!"

1203,"In Maximum Apocalypse, civilization has already fallen."
1203,The players are survivors of the apocalypse whose mission is to survive the hostile landscape.
1203,The game map is randomly generated and different every time that you play.
1203,"On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to explore the map, play cards, equip weapons, scavenge for resources, draw cards or battle off monsters."
1203,"Picking a unique survivor class within the group, players must plan their strategy and work together while leaning on their survivor’s strengths in order to defeat monsters and avoid starvation."
1203,"For example, the Fireman is deadly up close with his ax and can easily chop down monsters; meanwhile the stealthy Hunter is great at scouting the map and avoiding traps — but roaming monsters are gathering quickly and time is running out."
1203,"If you are overwhelmed by monsters or die of starvation, the players lose."
1203,"If they can find enough gas and get it back to their van to escape, they all win and live to play another scenario."

1204,The world has grown smaller.
1204,Civilizations around different continents have established independent free trade cities in order to ease trading between distant lands.
1204,"One of those cities, Yengzuh, is now looking for a new ruler – a new Trade Master."
1204,The post is only open every ten years and the selection of the said individual is no small task.
1204,It’s handled by holding a trading competition as it’s in everyone’s best interest to get the best merchant chosen for the job.
1204,"All the participating merchants are prestigious, but the competition also tests their ability to deal with unexpected situations."
1204,"After all, the winner will be responsible of keeping the global prices more fair and stable for years to come."
1204,There are only twelve free trade cities in the world.
1204,Yengzuh near Pandala is one of the oldest.
1204,The Guild of Extraordinary Traders from Dale promoted the founding of the city after the trade wars in Asia had spread too wide.
1204,"The city’s harbour has tens of great ships all the time, loading and unloading passengers and cargo."
1204,"In Dale of Merchants 2, players take the roles of those participating merchants learning new techniques, trading goods, and managing their stock."
1204,The player who first manages to complete their astounding merchant stall wins the game and gets access to the guild!
1204,Dale of Merchants 2 contains six new decks and can be played by itself or combined with the decks from Dale of Merchants.
1204,The game includes a new ruleset for four players that introduces team battle!
1204,These new rules greatly enhance the four-player experience by adding cooperation between teammates and cutting downtime.
1204,These rules can also be used with the original game's six decks.
1204,"The new decks are:
1)Crocodiles disturb other players
2)Platypuses have more control over cards
3)Polecats have a die
4)Owls are moved to action by things that happen (mostly what other players do)
5)Fennec foxes affect all players
6) Sloths do things at the start of your next turn"
1205,18Chesapeake is a member of the 18xx series of games.
1205,"The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham."
1205,18Chesapeake is set in the Chesapeake region of the United States and west to Ohio and the West Virginia Coalfields.
1205,"Two to six players represent investors in railroad companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned private companies and minor companies and later shares in public companies."
1205,The public companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its president).
1205,Public companies build track and run trains in order to earn revenues.
1205,Public company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock.
1205,"A feature of 18Chesapeake, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a public company’s president and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments."
1205,18Chesapeake is a moderate length game.
1205,"Experienced, brisk players can expect to take about 2-1/2 hours to complete a game."
1205,Novices or more deliberate players might add an hour to that time.

1206,"In Brian Boru: High King of Ireland, you strive to unite Ireland under your domain, securing control through might, cunning, and matrimony."
1206,"Join forces to fend off Viking invaders, build monasteries to extend your influence, and gather support in towns and villages throughout the land."
1206,"To become High King of all Ireland, you need to navigate a web of shifting alliances, outmaneuver your enemies, and grab history by the reins."
1206,"The success of the historical Brian Boru rested on three pillars: his victories against the Vikings, the favor he managed to garner with the Church, and the alliances he forged through political marriages."
1206,"This became the foundation of the game, with each pillar becoming a suit in the trick-taking that forms the core of the mechanisms."
1206,"Win a trick and you gain influence in a town, which, in turn, gains you majorities in the regions; if you lose the trick, however (deliberately or otherwise), you instead take an action corresponding to the suit of the card."
1207,"Every spring, millions of monarch butterflies leave Mexico to spread out across eastern North America."
1207,"Every fall, millions fly back to Mexico."
1207,"However, no single butterfly ever makes the round trip."
1207,Mariposas is a game of movement and set collection that lets players be part of this amazing journey.
1207,Mariposas is played in three seasons.
1207,"In general, your butterflies try to head north in spring, spread out in summer, and return south in fall."
1207,"The end of each season brings a scoring round, and at the end of fall, the player with the most successful family of butterflies — i.e., the most victory points — wins the game."

1208,Is she drawing an elk or a moose?
1208,Is he drawing a pegasus or a unicorn?
1208,These are the types of questions you will probably be asking yourself during a game of Pictomania!
1208,"There's no time to draw a complex masterpiece in Pictomania, the drawing game in which everybody draws and everybody guesses — all at the same time!"
1208,Players sketch the essence of the word with a few quick lines and try to guess the others' drawings while there's still time.
1208,This second edition of Pictomania features revised word cards with a brand new look.
1208,"One big change for this edition compared to the base game is that only three word cards are in play no matter the player count, allowing you to jump into each round more quickly since you don't have to read as many words to guess who might be drawing what."
1209,"Players in Qwinto all play at the same time, with everyone trying to fill the rows on their scoresheets with numbers as quickly — and as highly — as possible in order to score the most points."
1209,"To set up, each player receives a scoresheet that contains three colored rows of shapes (mostly circles with a few pentagons); the rows don't completely overlap, but they do overlap enough to create five vertical columns of three shapes, with one pentagon being in each vertical row."
1209,"On a turn, a player rolls 1–3 dice, with the dice being the same colors as the rows: orange, yellow, purple."
1209,Each player can place whatever sum is rolled into an empty shape in a row that matches the color of one of the dice.
1209,"Two rules must be followed when placing a sum in a row:

All numbers in a row must increase from left to right."
1209,No number can be repeated in a vertical column.
1209,"A player does not have to enter the number in a row, but if the active player, the one who rolled the dice, doesn't do so, then they must mark a misthrow box on their scoresheet."
1209,The game continues until someone has filled two rows on their scoresheet or someone has tallied four misthrows.
1209,"Players then tally their points: For each completed column on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the number in that column's pentagon."
1209,"For each completed row on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the rightmost number in that row."
1209,"For each incomplete row on their scoresheet, a player scores one point per number in that row."
1209,"For each misthrow, a player loses five points."
1209,Whoever has the highest sum wins!
1210,"Balduin, the house ghost, found an old camera in the castle cellar."
1210,"Immediately he photographed everything that he loves to make disappear when he is haunting  – including himself, of course."
1210,"Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors."
1210,"Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue."
1210,"Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next."
1210,"Can you help him with his haunting and quickly name the right item, or even make it disappear by yourself?"
1210,"If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning..."
1210,"The lightning fast shape and color recognition game that is sure to test the reflexes of kids, families and gamers alike."
1210,"In Ghost Blitz, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book, and a comfortable red chair."
1210,"Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way."
1210,"With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the ""right"" object – but which object is right?"
1210,"If one object is colored correctly – say, a green bottle and a red mouse – then players need to grab that correctly colored object."
1210,"If both objects are colored incorrectly – say, a green ghost and a red mouse – then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown."
1210,"In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book."
1210,"The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck."
1210,"If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected."
1210,"Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!"
1210,"Reimplements:

Knapp daneben, released in 2004 by HABA."
1211,"Journey deeper into the world of the Crucible in Age of Ascension, the second age of KeyForge!"
1211,"This continuation of the world's first Unique Deck Game contains 204 new cards seamlessly integrated into a card pool that contains a total of 370 different cards, creating an entirely new collection of Archon Decks for you to discover, explore, and master!"
1211,"The KeyForge: Age of Ascension two-player starter provides you with all the tools you need to either begin or expand your adventures on the Crucible, featuring two unique Age of Ascension Archon Decks, a Quickstart Rulebook, two Poster Playmats, and all the keys, tokens, and chain trackers you and your chosen opponent need to start playing!"
1211,"In more detail, KeyForge is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious Æmber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults."
1211,"You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House."
1211,"For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare ""Sanctum"" at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum."
1211,Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.
1211,"Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent."
1211,"If you wish to weaken your rival's forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength."
1211,"Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more Æmber to your pool."
1211,"Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost — choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity!"
1211,Yet balance is key.
1211,"If you simply reap more Æmber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren."
1211,"But if you focus on the thrill of the fight alone and neglect the collection of Æmber, you won't move any closer to your goal!"
1211,"If you succeed in finding a harmony within your team and have six Æmber at the start of your turn, you'll forge a key and move one step closer to victory."
1211,The first to forge three keys wins!
1212,Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena.
1212,"Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them."
1212,"To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand."
1212,"Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc."
1212,"), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands."
1212,"The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so."
1212,"Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both."
1212,"When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew."
1212,"With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!"
1213,The time is summer 1944.
1213,The Sun shines on Normandie hedgerows.
1213,"Gentle wind, fields of bright flowers, and in the background, the romantic staccato of machine gun fire in the morning."
1213,"In these typical French countryside landscapes, thousands of men are about to fight."
1213,And die.
1213,"Bravely like heroes, or cowardly like wussies."
1213,But only heroes really matter.
1213,Those you see in Hollywood Golden Age war movies.
1213,"Here lies the inspiration for Heroes of Normandie; here is what the game has to offer: explosive and fast-paced battles; the pleasure of butchering your enemies through MG42 walls of lead; and the ability to crush Nazi bastards under tons of shells – basically, blood and guts."
1213,"A miniatures game without miniatures, Heroes of Normandie is a fast-paced WW2 strategy wargame inspired by Hollywood war movies."
1213,"A tactical scale board-game opposing two players and two armies, with the Germans on one side and the Americans on the other."
1213,Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff.
1213,"While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up."
1213,Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent.
1213,Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies.
1213,Deploy your units and don't turn back!
1214,Keyper is a game with high player interaction for two to four players played over four rounds.
1214,"Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter."
1214,"Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples."
1214,"Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc."
1214,The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.
1214,Keyper is a worker placement game.
1214,"(Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.)"
1214,"What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players."
1214,"In this way, some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others."
1214,All keyples have the potential to work twice.
1214,"If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn, the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions."
1214,"It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term."
1214,"The country boards are also noteworthy, in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn, and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season."
1214,"A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice."
1214,"Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer, after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village."
1214,Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.
1214,A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons.
1214,"Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs."
1214,"Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season."
1214,"The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies."
1214,"In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction."
1214,"A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with ""character"" keyples and keypers will also be released."
1215,Norse law dictates that every man shall posses a weapon at all times.
1215,"The need to swiftly wield an axe in the name of battle, honor, or revenge was ever-present."
1215,Valhalla will not be filled with the weak.
1215,"In Fire & Axe: A Viking Saga, originally released as Viking Fury, you vie for glory across three epic Viking sagas, each one a different journey to raid, trade, and settle territories."
1215,Will you choose the path of diplomacy and trade for victory?
1215,Or will your longship cast a bloody wake?
1215,Start your journey by gathering crew and goods to outfit your boat.
1215,Will your ships be filled with warrior or goods?
1215,Settlers or sackers?
1215,"After your launch from bustling ports into the open sea, you must choose your path to power — but don't get lost in the wind; the sea will gladly devour souls who take her lightly..."
1215,"The life of a Viking is one of power and glory, or untold sorrow."
1215,Which shall be your destiny?
1216,Players take on the role of dwarves.
1216,"As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold."
1216,"Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp."
1216,The saboteur has struck.
1216,But which of the players are saboteurs?
1216,"Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first?"
1216,"After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner."
1216,"With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur."
1216,The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.
1216,"The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card."
1216,The Goal Cards are placed face-down.
1216,"The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which."
1216,Players have cards in hand.
1216,"On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass."
1216,The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards.
1216,Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card.
1216,"All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways."
1216,"The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this."
1216,"They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered."
1216,"Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself."
1216,"Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards."
1216,"Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over."
1216,The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.
1216,The round is also over if the gold could not be reached.
1216,"In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces."
1216,"Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins."
1216,"The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner."
1217,"1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties is an 18xx game set in East Anglia, England."
1217,"It features a company-packed board, where 16 of 20 companies are randomly selected for use on a board containing only 37 hexes."
1217,"Major features of the game are:

 Petitioning parliament as a means of floating your preferred company
 a mixture of full and partial capitalisation for companies
 three train types with differing objectives and building requirements
 company mergers and re-floatation
 1860-style semi-linear stock-market featuring multiple stock jumps."
1218,"The oasis-like basin Faiyum was artificially built 3,900 years ago by enlarging the Bahr Yussef channel that connected to the Nile to create a regulated flood plain."
1218,"During the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, this swampland was slowly changed into farmland under the aegis of pharaohs such as Amenemhet III and Sesostris II."
1218,They ordered their advisors to build a system of canals and dikes to reclaim the land surrounded by desert and inhabited by crocodiles to turn it into a granary for Egypt.
1218,"Now, during the reign of Amenemhet III, you are the pharaoh's advisors, commanded to harvest goods, build roads, found settlements, and do much more for the good of Faiyum!"
1218,"You are being supplied with the necessary manpower, resources, and money, which means that if another advisor needs to use ""your"" roads, farms, and other buildings, they may do so since everything you build is owned by the pharaoh."
1218,The only thing you will own is the only thing that matters: the respect of the pharaoh.
1218,Faiyum is a strategic game for enthusiasts of planning games.
1218,The basic rules are simple: Play your cards one by one on your personal discard stack.
1218,"After playing some or all of your cards, you take them back into your hand in ""reverse"" playing order, so playing cards in the best order is important."
1218,"Newly purchased cards go directly into your hand, so the timing of getting and playing them is important, too."
1218,"Each of the individual cards has easy-to-understand actions, but only by creating the best combined ""engine"" will you be a master advisor of Faiyum."
1218,This game features a card mechanism reminiscent of deck builders and the market mechanism successfully used in Power Grid.
1218,"Gain more and more valuable cards, and use the structures built on the game board to your advantage — in other words, for your reputation."
1218,"In the end, the most cunning advisor who creates the best card combinations will win Faiyum."
1219,"Description from the publisher:

1224,"The storyline in Friedemann Friese's Fearsome Floors (aka, Finstere Flure) continues the FFF-saga from Friese's earlier game, with players trying to escape from Fürst Fieso."
1224,"Story aside, what we have is a wonderful race game in which the players must move through a dungeon as quickly as possible – or at least within 14 turns – before it crumbles over their heads."
1224,"Players could reach the exit in only seven turns if everything were peaceful and quiet, but unfortunately the dungeon is also the home of a very hungry monster!"
1224,"Each round, players take turns moving one disk at a time, flipping over the disk after moving it to reveal the movement points available for the next round."
1224,"They can try to lead the monster, who is always after fresh prey, to opponents' pieces, but they may find themselves eaten instead!"
1224,Pieces can slide along blood slicks or might be crushed between a boulder and a wall.
1224,"You can even try to get the monster to teleport to another part of the board, where it will fall upon its next victim!"
1225,"Description from the publisher:
Mega Civilization, a huge version of the legendary development game Civilization, is a game of skill for 5 to 18 players covering the historical development of ancient civilizations from just after the last Ice Age to the dawn of the new era at the end of the Iron Age — a time span of almost 8,000 years."
1225,Each player leads their own civilization as it tries to expand its culture over a map board that stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to India.
1225,"Although battles and territorial strategy are important, Mega Civilization is not a wargame as you might expect when looking at the map board."
1225,"Instead, the objective of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, scientific, political, civic, and religious factors."
1225,The player who most effectively balances these various goals will achieve the best scores and win.
1225,"In more detail, the objective of Mega Civilization is to acquire the highest number of victory points (VPs) by building cities and developing Civilization Advances."
1225,"This will be done over various phases and turns, some of which will be performed simultaneously by the players."
1225,"After each turn, a check is made for each player to move forward on the Archaeological Succession Table (A.S.T.)."
1225,Each step on this timeline represents a certain period of time in history reaching from the Stone Age.
1225,Advancement there will provide even more VPs.
1225,The winner will not necessarily be the first player to reach the end of the A.S.T.
1225,"or the player with the highest number of cities or Civilization Advances, although these are the key factors in determining the winner."
1225,"Each civilization begins with a single population token, and every turn each player increases their population by adding tokens to each area they occupy."
1225,These tokens can be moved over the map board by land or (using ships) by sea.
1225,"As each area has a population limit, a good strategic overview will give players advantage in occupying more and more areas."
1225,"If a player manages to move sufficient tokens into an area, they can build a city there."
1225,These cities generate trade cards which will eventually lead to wealth.
1225,"During trade sessions, players receive not only the commodities they need to complete sets; they might also receive calamities which will remove population or cities."
1225,Specific Civilization Advances will protect the players from natural or civic calamities.
1225,"The development of these Civilization Advances is symbolized by turning in sets of trading goods, as the wealthier civilizations will acquire more Civilization Advances."
1225,"As civilizations develop, it will be harder for their rulers to find the right balance between future population growth, maintaining enough support for their cities, and increasing their treasury."
1225,"If they cannot manage their token population, their cities might eventually revolt during the tax collection phase."
1225,The civilizations with the strongest economy traditionally score the highest.
1225,A game of Mega Civilization can take 10-12 hours to complete.
1225,"Players can also choose to play the beginner scenario — ""The First Game"" — which takes only 1-2 hours."
1225,"Another scenario — ""The Short Game"" — provides the same excitement as the full game, although the game starts in a later age; by doing this, games can be played in ""only"" 6-8 hours."
1226,Your Roll Player characters have been called to adventure!
1226,"In Monsters & Minions, you went to war against Dragul invaders."
1226,"In Fiends & Familiars, you befriended wild beasts and dispelled cruel spirits."
1226,"Now your fully formed, battle-hardened heroes must defend the kingdom of Nalos and uncover a mystery that lies at the heart of the Abandoned Lands."
1226,Navigate your missions with care.
1226,It's up to you who to befriend and who to battle.
1226,Will you slay the giant troll or attempt to make peace?
1226,Will you do the vampire's bidding or defend the mysterious cultists he wants to destroy?
1226,Will you remain loyal to king and country — or side with the enemies of Nalos?
1226,"Whatever choices you make, someone will remember and respond."
1226,Roll Player Adventures is a co-operative storybook board game for 1-4 players set in the world of Roll Player.
1226,"Players inhabit characters, face challenges, and make decisions that will change the story as they progress through eleven core adventures and a replayable side quest."
1226,Adventures does not require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play.
1226,"Pick from one of six pre-generated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey."
1226,"If you do import a character you've built in Roll Player, any number of expansions and any number of promo cards/boards that were used may continue to be used in Roll Player Adventures."
1227,This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore.
1227,"The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches."
1227,"The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards."
1227,"On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process."
1227,"When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in."
1227,"After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points."
1227,The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.
1227,"As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow."
1227,"But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game."
1227,"The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game."
1228,"Settling the Final Frontier
Since 1966, millions of Star Trek fans all over the world have watched adventures of the Starship Enterprise, Captain Kirk, and Mr. Spock."
1228,"And since 1995, millions of enthusiastic players all over the world have played Klaus Teuber's Catan - a board game classic."
1228,It's time to bring them all together on the Final Frontier!
1228,"In Star Trek: Catan, players start the game with two small Outposts at the intersection of three planets, with each planet supplying resources based on the result of a dice roll."
1228,"Players collect and trade these resources – dilithium, tritanium, food, oxygen and water – in order to build Starships that connect regions in the galaxy, establish more Outposts and Starbases (upgraded Outposts) at new intersection points in order to increase resource acquisition, and acquire Development Cards that provide Victory Points (VPs) or special abilities."
1228,"On a dice roll of 7, a Klingon ship swoops in to prevent resource production on one planet while taxing spacegoers who hold too many resources."
1228,Star Trek: Catan differs from the basic Settlers in one aspect: a set of Support Cards formerly available only in German as Catan Scenarios: Helpers of Catan.
1228,"Each Support Card features a special ability and one of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, or Sarek."
1228,"Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn't otherwise produce for them."
1228,"Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage."
1228,"When a player uses a Support Card ability for the first time, they may trade it in for a Support Card of their choice or keep it for a second use, but they may only trade immediately after use."
1229,Imagine that you are one of the crew in your favorite science fiction TV show.
1229,Now imagine that in the last 10 minutes of the show things have gone so badly that the captain is dead and you and the surviving members of your crew have to pull together and save the day yourselves!
1229,The Captain Is Dead is a co-op game for 2 to 7 players.
1229,"All you have to do is get the ship's engines (aka ""Jump Core"") back online and you win, but because there is a hostile alien ship trying to destroy you, that is easier said than done."
1229,"You have an impressive star ship full of useful systems that will help you fend off the aliens, and get the Jump Core back online."
1229,Each system gives you an advantage while it remains online.
1229,The assault from the hostile alien ship tends to keep knocking those systems offline however.
1229,"So you need to balance your time between keeping the ships system's online, fending off the alien threat, and completing your objective."
1229,Each member of your crew has special abilities and skills.
1229,You need to work as a group to maximize the potential of each role.
1229,"If someone tries to be a hero, you'll all die."
1230,Welcome to Fireball Island!
1230,You may have heard stories.
1230,You may have visited when you were younger.
1230,Perhaps you even saw a fireball engulf a fellow traveler in a hellscape of horror that makes you afraid to close your eyes at night.
1230,"Whatever the case, welcome back!"
1230,"Turns out that Vul-Kar didn't like having his gem stolen way back when, so there has been some volcanic upheaval, an explosion in our snake population, feral tigers, new types of trees bent on ending human life, and swarms of bees everywhere."
1230,But don't worry — we have top people working on it.
1230,Start your day of adventure at the helipad.

1230,It is a family-weight game for 2-4 players (5 with an expansion) that plays in 30-45 minutes.
1230,"Simple card play replaces the random roll-and-move of the original, and the set collection for the treasures offers some interesting choices for players."
1230,"Remember, you don't have to outrun the fireball — just the other players."

1230,Vous avez peut-être entendu des histoires.
1230,Vous l'avez peut-être visité quand vous étiez plus jeune.

1230,"Quoi qu'il en soit, bon retour sur l'Île!"
1230,"Il s'avère que Vul-Kar n'a pas apprécié qu'on lui vole sa gemme ... alors il y a eu des bouleversements volcaniques, une croissance de notre population de serpents, des tigres sauvages, de nouveaux types d'arbres pour mettre fin à la vie humaine & des essaims d'abeilles partout."

1231,Wings of War is a game series which merges card and board game mechanics to recreate aerial combat.
1231,"The first series of Wings of War games focus on the ""knights of the air"" age, World War I, portraying the abilities of the fighting planes of this period."
1231,Airplanes are represented by a single card which is used as a playing piece on any open surface; the players choose and play simultaneously movement cards  to decide the actions of the airplane they control.
1231,"Different planes use different decks of movement cards to represent their different maneuver capabilities, and different deck of ""Fire"" card are used to take into account their fighting effectiveness and to keep track of damage."
1231,"Each Wings of War set is a complete game for 2 to 4 players which may be combined with additional sets, or with other copies of the same set, to play larger games."
1231,"For that purpose, 23 planes with different colors are included in each box."
1231,Each one is depicted after accurate historical documentation.
1231,Wings of War: Famous Aces is the first set of the WWI collection.
1231,"It includes 5 types of planes: the Spad XIII, Albatros D Va, Sopwith Camel, Fokker Dr1, Sopwith Triplane."
1231,"Each one was flown by an ace: between them Baracca, von Richtofen, Rickenbacker, Fonck, Olieslagers, Bakers."
1231,"There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card of the second set, Wings of War: Watch Your Back!, depicting an Austrian two-seater Ufag C.I."
1232,Each player starts with a piece of paper and a pencil.
1232,"At the top of the paper, each player writes a sentence."
1232,Then they pass the papers to their left.
1232,"The next player ""draws"" the sentence a la Pictionary, then folds the paper so only the drawing is visible and passes it to their left."
1232,The next player looks at the drawing and writes a sentence that they think the drawing represents.
1232,This continues until all players have their original paper back.
1232,"At the end, all players unfold their paper, and much hilarity ensues as ""I am the Walrus, koo-koo-ca-choo"" becomes ""Hitler and I danced the night away in a disco."""
1232,"The game continues until everyone runs out of paper or everyone has added something to each paper, always ending on a sentence."
1232,"Eat Poop You Cat does not comport with the BGG guidelines for what constitutes a game, but is kept in the database by popular demand and administrative fiat."
1232,E.g.

1233,"In The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet, each player will build his own planet to provide a beautiful home for the dear animals of The Little Prince – the fox, the sheep, the elephant and the snake – but make sure there aren't too many volcanoes and baobab trees!"
1233,"Each round, the start player chooses one of the four stacks of tiles and takes as many tiles as the number of players."
1233,He chooses one of them and appoints a different player to choose another tile.
1233,This new player takes the tile and starts building her own planet in front of her.
1233,"Then she appoints another player, and so on, until every player gets a tile."
1233,The last player must take the only tile that remains.
1233,"To make up for that, this player becomes the start player for the next round."
1233,"Baobab trees grow on some tiles, and having too many of them is bad."
1233,"If a player has three baobab trees on his planet, the three tiles bearing these trees have to be turned face down."
1233,Now the items on those tiles won't score you points at the end of the game!
1233,"By the end of the game, four characters will be located around each player's planet, earning that player points based on the various items present on the planet."
1233,"Not everything is risk-free, though, as the player who has the highest number of volcanoes loses as many points as the number of volcanoes on his planet."
1233,The player with the highest score wins!
1234,"Starship Catan is a two-player card game that is thematically similar to Starfarers of Catan, but has different game play."

1239,"Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance."
1239,This is #1 in the Mystery Rummy series.
1240,"Game description from the publisher:
Built by the Romans during the first century in Belgian Gaul, Tournay experienced most of its growth along the Scheldt river."
1240,"Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city."
1240,That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity.
1240,"This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries."
1240,"Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil."
1240,Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!
1240,Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche.
1240,"In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens."
1240,The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks.
1240,"Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings."
1240,"In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens."
1240,The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned.
1240,It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations.
1240,"Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed."
1240,But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!
1240,"Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!"
1240,"Game Summary
There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards."
1240,"There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad."
1240,"Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card."
1240,"On your turn:

 First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc)."
1240,"You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card."
1240,"Then take one action:
 Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s)."
1240,"If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin."
1240,"Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc."
1240,"Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward."
1240,"Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you."
1240,"Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards."
1240,"The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed."

1240,"Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated."
1240,Most VP wins!
1241,Warsaw is a unique city.
1241,"It is said that it ""survived its own death"", and there is truth in this."
1241,"Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process."
1241,"Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings."
1241,"Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance."
1241,"Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay."
1241,"Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination."
1241,Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is.
1241,"Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined."
1241,Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.
1241,"In Warsaw: City of Ruins, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times."
1241,Each player creates their own district of the city.
1241,"At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners."
1241,"After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins."
1241,"In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs."
1241,"During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player."
1241,"Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table."
1241,"All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:

 Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank."
1241,Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.
1241,"Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile."
1241,"Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely."
1241,"As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers."
1241,A player's district can never be larger than a 3×4 or 4×3 rectangle of tiles.
1241,"Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings."
1241,"Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other."
1241,They also occupy an entire tile.
1241,"During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points."

1242,"These cards have 6 squares, possibly occupied by an obstacle (pyramid), and belonging to one of five benefactors (with their own color and symbol): Sir Brown, Lady Violet, Miss Blackmore, Lord Lemon and Colonel Tangerine."
1242,"Each player has their own personal pool of archaeologists that can be used to:
- Start an excavation (requiring one archaeologist)
- Expand an excavation (requiring two archaeologists in addition to one archaeologist already on the board)
- Play a benefactor previously earned
- Pass
Benefactors give special benefits like moving over an obstacle or retrieving archaeologists faster, etc ...
Once all players have passed, we resolve the board according to area control."
1242,The player in the first position can either take a card available or go to the museum.
1242,Other players can then do the same.
1242,Ties are resolved according to player order.
1242,"Going to the Museum adds value for a colour at endgame to the cards collected (x2, x3 or x5)."
1242,"At the end of the 4th round, the final exhibition is resolved and the winning player will be whoever collected the most prestige between:
- Points on the cards collected during game
- Points by colour benefactors (according to position in the museum)
- Bonus points for sets of cards (1 in every colour of benefactors)."

1244,Each player begins with 2 Colonies and a Space Port (all components are made from plastic).
1244,The Space Port makes starships to transport your new colonies and trade posts to distant lands.
1244,"Throughout the game, all the colonies and spaceports enable the production of resources when the dice match the numbers of adjacent planets."
1244,"Resources are traded for colony ships, trade ships, and fleet upgrades of freight rings, booster rockets, and cannon."

1245,"It is up to the players to work together in order to outlast the horrors awaiting them by coordinating strategy, utilizing the strengths of their unique divisions (Med Bay, Weapons Research, Science Lab, and Armory), and organizing defense tactics to ensure no player is caught off-guard by surprise attacks."

1246,Welcome to the Dungeon — first released as Dungeon of Mandom — is a push-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters.
1246,Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds.
1246,Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side.
1246,The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side.
1246,A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.
1246,The game is played in rounds.
1246,The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped.
1246,This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.
1246,"Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn."
1246,"If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon."
1246,Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later.
1246,"If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round."
1246,"Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped."
1246,The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within.
1246,Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP.
1246,"If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round."
1246,"If not, they lose."
1246,The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.
1246,The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.
1246,Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.

1248,"A ""dice"" version of The Castles of Burgundy."
1248,The famous strategy game now in pure dice!
1248,"As influential sovereigns, expand your estates through trade and commerce."
1248,Combine the dice to your advantage and find the strategy that will lead you to victory.
1248,"Like the original game, the goal is to get the most points, mostly by filling spaces on your board to complete as many color regions as you can."
1248,"The game comes with 5 dice: one timer die, 2 number dice and 2 color dice."
1248,"The game is played using a ""roll and write"" mechanic, where one player rolls the dice, and from the results, each player individually picks one color die, representing a type of hex, and one number die, and uses their chosen combinations to fill in a hex on their individual player board."
1248,"Each player starts with one castle space already filled in; from there, a hex can only be filled on the board if it is adjacent to an already-filled hex."
1248,Each type of hex has its own rules for which numbers can be used to fill it.
1248,"When completing a region of hexes, you score points and get a reward depending on the type of hex, which can be workers or monks that you can use to manipulate the dice, silver coins that you can spend to take extra actions or goods that you can later ship for even more points."
1248,"In addition, bonus points are awarded to the first and second players to fill in all hexes on their board of each color."
1248,The timer die sets the pace of the game.
1248,"When it is rolled, players mark a number of boxes on the time track equal to the number of hourglasses rolled on the timer die (one or two)."
1248,This progresses the game through three phases of ten time boxes each.
1248,"When all time boxes are filled, the game is over and the player with the most points wins."
1249,"In The Staufer Dynasty, the players are nobles in the 12th century, accompanying Henry VI on his tour of the areas of Europe brought under control by the Staufer family, an area that included much of modern-day Germany, from the Baltic Sea in the north to Sicily in the south."
1249,You're eager to improve your own lot in the land by placing envoys and nobles in positions of power in the six regions represented in this game.
1249,The game lasts five rounds with each player having three actions per round.
1249,Players take actions in order of their family members on the action board from top to bottom; on a turn you either take a supply action (moving to one side of the action board) or a move/deploy action (moving to the other side).
1249,"For a supply action, you pick one of the spaces on the supply table, move the indicated number of envoys and nobles from the province to your personal court, then claim any chests underneath that space."
1249,"The treasure chests come in different colors, with each color having a different function in the game: the brown treasure chests score points based on how many you collect, the orange ones provide immediate points or figures, the blue ones provide a one-shot bonus, and the purple ones let you collect one of the privilege cards on display."
1249,The privilege cards often modify other actions or give you a bonus for doing a particular thing.
1249,"For a move/deploy action, you decide which office seat you want to occupy in a particular region."
1249,"If this seat isn't in the region where the king is located, you need to spend one envoy as you move clockwise away from the king, placing each envoy in the top part of those regions, until you reach the region that you want to occupy."
1249,"You then pay the cost of the office seat, placing one figure — possibly a noble if the seat demands it — in that seat and all the other figures in clockwise order, one per region."
1249,"When you occupy a seat, you claim the chest underneath it."
1249,"After everyone has finished their actions, you score for the round — but you score only in the region indicated in the current row of scoring tiles (Aachen, Nijmegen, Palermo, etc.)"
1249,"and the region that best meets the condition laid out in a separate part of the current row of scoring tiles (fewest chests, most occupants, where the king is located, etc.)"
1249,"If these two regions turn out to be the same one, you score that region only once."
1249,Players score points for having the most office seats in a region (or the second- or thirdmost most office seats) based on the point tile placed in the region at the start of the game.
1249,"Each region also has a printed bonus that players receive, such as bonus chests or additional envoys."
1249,"To end the round, you remove all of the office occupants of the region that scored, add new chests under each office seat in those scoring regions and each space on the supply table, then sweep the king clockwise 1-3 regions."
1249,"As the king moves, he returns all of the envoys that he encounters in the regions that he enters to their owners."
1249,"After five rounds, players score for their treasure chests as well as for how well they completed their secret job cards, and the player with the most points wins."
1250,The largest Roman city north of the Alps in the late Roman Empire was Augusta Treverorum.

1250,"Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully."
1250,The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck.
1250,Buildings are erected physically at the various locations around the city using 3D building pieces.

1256,"If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island – which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there."
1256,The game is played in three rounds.
1256,A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken.
1256,Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them.

1257,"If you are looking for great social interaction and lots of laughs, then you will probably enjoy playing Say Anything."
1257,"History
Say Anything was designed by Dominic Crapuchettes & Satish Pillalamarri."

1258,Coloma is the town where an unexpected event happened that shaped history of the Western Frontier.
1258,In the winter of 1848 a man building a sawmill on the South Fork of the American River spotted some bright nuggets in the tailrace waters below.
1258,"Sure enough, it was gold!"
1258,"Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word spread quickly and it triggered the California Gold Rush of ‘49."
1258,"Thousands of people arrived from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing boomtowns in the country."
1258,"Claims were staked, camps and makeshift homes were built, and hotels and saloons sprung up almost overnight."
1258,Everyone wanted their cut of the land’s wealth.
1258,For many it was Coloma or Bust!
1258,"In the game of Coloma, you are a pioneer who has recently traveled out West to strike it rich and make a name for yourself."
1258,"You will prospect for gold and use your windfalls to recruit workers, rustle up horses, and establish businesses."
1258,You will also get opportunities to explore the surrounding riverways and frontier lands.
1258,But alas!
1258,You are not alone—every other pioneer seems to have gotten the same idea!
1258,"Therefore, it will take extra cunning tactics on your part to not go Bust with the rest of them…
Overview of Play
At the beginning of each chapter, you and the other players will simultaneously select an action to perform on the board."
1258,"Once your selections are revealed, you must check if a majority of players chose the same action."
1258,"If so, it is a Bust—which disables the Boom bonus that would be included otherwise."
1258,"Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons on the map, building bridges and businesses, and placing camps and gunmen."
1258,"After that, a section of the board is rotated—slightly changing the layout of the actions for the upcoming chapter."
1258,"When the rotating section hits high noon, the round ends with a bang: a shootout against an ever-growing number of outlaws!"
1258,"If you and the other players can outnumber the outlaws with your combined gunmen, you will get your fair share of the rewards."
1258,"But if not, the rewards drop, and some of the gunmen will go to the graveyard..."
1258,"The game ends after the third shootout, and the player with the most points wins!"
1258,Coloma is a fast moving game with many paths to victory.
1258,"It offers unique twists on simultaneous action selection, resource management, and engine-building."
1258,"The town cards in your tableau allow you to play more efficiently, gain extra actions, and bend the rules to your advantage."
1258,"With these cards and the bridge tiles (which add points based on what you achieve), you can create the perfect combination for your strategy and play style."

1260,Conversion Phase - each god gains victory points for every island they have a prophet or temple on.
1260,God gains bonus victory points if they dominate the entire island.
1260,Moreover there is the Navel of the World Island.

1260,"If your prophet can manage to take the city, he builds a temple for your greatness."
1260,After that all prophets are taken off the map and the round ends.
1260,Now you have entirely new generation of prophets to flick into the archipelago.
1260,After 4 rounds bonus points are dealt out and the winner is the god with most victory points gathered so far.
1260,Numbers included in the section above may vary depending on the number of players.

1268,"In a dark and claustrophobic deep sea mining site, the uncovering of a mysterious “Sphere” is dragging everyone nearby into the endless madness."
1268,"The fears deep within one’s mind are amplified and transformed into horrifying monsters from other dimensions, torturing one's body and testing their sanity."
1268,Only those with extraordinary will and conviction can escape its devastating grasp.
1268,"Deep Madness is a fully cooperative board game for 1-6 players with 66 amazingly detailed miniatures, depicting a sci-fi horror world inspired by Lovecraft’s work and the Alien series."
1268,"In the game, players assume the roles of investigators, venturing into the seemingly empty yet perilous deep sea mining site to find out the truth behind the lost contact event."
1268,Unimaginable horror and madness from the dark fear within is waiting.
1268,Deep Madness is based on multiple scenarios from a continuous storyline.
1268,"Each scenario has its own unique board setup, rules, special effects, and goals."
1268,"From resolving fatal crises to struggling with overwhelming bosses, the investigators will face various quests filled with strategical decisions and fierce combat."
1268,"With each scenario achieved, they are one step closer to the truth, but also one step deeper into the world of madness."
1268,"Each scenario of the game plays in a limited number of game rounds, if the investigators fail to achieve the goals before the last round ends, the game is lost and everyone is consumed."
1268,"Each game round consists of 4 phases: Devour Phase, Spawn Phase, Activation Phase, and Refresh Phase."
1268,"In Devour Phase, the Devour Marker progresses one step forward along the Devour Track, indicating the world going deeper into madness."
1268,"As the Devour Marker progressing, more and more rooms (map tiles) are flipped to their madness side."
1268,These rooms will spawn monsters and provide various nasty effects to hinder the investigators or to boost the monsters.
1268,"In Spawn Phase, different types of monsters with unique abilities are spawned in the flipped rooms."
1268,"Monsters do not show their existence in fixed locations, they could be spawned right next to the investigators if they ventured carelessly."
1268,"Activation Phase is the core of the game, the investigators and the monsters take turns to act alternately."
1268,"Monsters do not wait for all investigators to finish their turns like in other cooperative games, but do act between them, so careless planning would put the investigators who are later in the turn order into grave danger, facing fatal attacks before they had a chance to act."
1268,"In Refresh Phase, some maintenances are performed, and some special effects are resolved."
1268,"In each investigator’s turn, it is crucial that the player chooses 3 actions to take wisely."
1268,"Each kind of action has its own value, and every single decision could be life and death in Deep Madness."
1268,"Unfortunately, the correct decision is rarely obvious."
1268,"Moving, attacking, searching, exchanging items, locking the doors, and recovering sanity are the basic actions."
1268,"Additionally, each investigator also has his/her own unique and irreplaceable abilities to activate."
1268,Different combinations of investigators provide distinctive strategies and game experiences.
1268,Monster acts according to its own action pool during its turn.
1268,"In Deep Madness monsters are highly characteristic, not just in stats, but also in abilities and behaviors."
1268,Different combinations of monsters provide unique challenges.
1268,"And due to the intertwined activation mechanism, even different turn orders of the monsters make each game session different."
1268,"However, no matter how the monsters setup is, Deep Madness will be a very challenging game, even death could be a strategy."
1268,"In the game, investigators battle the horrific monsters, survive the harsh crises, and above all, save their own minds from the devouring of madness."
1268,"They are given many chances to consume their own sanity, to activate their abilities, to use the effects of items, to reroll the dice, and etc."
1268,However they are vulnerable when the sanity is low.
1268,"After an investigator with insanity tokens manages to kill a monster, the monster will corrupt his/her mind, by permanently flipping the insanity tokens into madness tokens."
1268,"As the madness token cumulates, horror haunts the investigator by resolving Madness Cards, and each of them has unique negative effect and terrifying flavor text."

1284,"The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game."
1284,"As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles."
1284,Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.

1285,"In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task."
1285,"Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase."
1285,Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliment.
1285,"When enough players want to hire mercenaries, there is an auction for their services."
1285,"The flipside is that the more mercenaries that are hired, the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase."
1285,"The mixing of these two clever mechanics, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game."
1285,Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.
1285,"If the other players all collect political influence, a Parliment might be called when one or two players has only a single vote."
1285,These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.

1297,A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.
1297,Description from the publisher.
1297,The world of Blue Moon is in chaos.
1297,"Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all!"
1297,"In this original 2-player game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance."
1297,"The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures."
1297,Expansion packs contain additional people cards.
1297,Blue Moon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.
1298,Twin temples of two forgotten divinities containing ancient relics have been discovered in India.
1298,"You set off on a treasure hunt, racing to find them before your rival, but your progress is slowed by a constantly shifting maze of paths... And eternal damnation awaits anyone foolish enough to uncover the three cursed relics of Garuda!"
1298,MOVE QUICKLY...
1298,CHOOSE WISELY!
1298,"A treasure race packed with tough choices, twists & turns!"
1298,"In this 2-players game, each player moves around their own temple, which has spaces for room tiles and hiding places for 9 sacred and cursed relics around."
1298,"These relics are placed randomly, face-down, around the temples and worth victory points once flipped face-up."
1298,The first player to score 25 victory points wins the game.
1298,"However, a player loses if they reveal all three cursed relics!"
1298,"Each round, the players compete to win a new room tile by using cards allowing them to throw fate sticks."
1298,The player with the most fate points showing on their sticks wins the room tile and places it in their temple.
1298,"Each player attempts to create paths leading to their relics, enabling them to flip them face up and score victory points."
1298,"Yet, Naga symbols on some sticks let you activate cards with powerful effects, so that you can never take anything for granted."
1298,"A GAMEPLAY WITH DUAL-USE CARDS AND STICKS

Players must decide how to use the cards in their hands: for throwing sticks or activating their effects?"
1298,"Card effects can be applied on you or opponent's game and are relating to:

 Sticks results
 Relic positions
 Room positions
 Card drawing

Results on Fate sticks can be used to win the room at stake (using their Fate points) or to activate cards (using their Naga symbols)."
1298,There are 3 types of sticks (number of Fate points or Naga faces are different for each type).
1298,"DILEMMAS, TWISTS, LOW BLOWS!"
1298,"No temple room or Relic is locked in place, they can be moved/removed as you or your opponent activate cards… You could turn everything upside-down!"
1298,"For example:

 Make the maze slide
 Swap the positions of relics
 Place a Trap room in your opponent’s Temple
 Change the results of the sticks
 Discard action cards from your opponent's hand
 Make him throw again his sticks…

IF YOU...

 Have ever dreamed of being an Indiana Jones, chasing relics in an Indian modular temple...
 Adore putting a spoke in the wheels of your opponent...
 Love gameplays balanced between strategy (cruel choices, anticipation) and fun...

then Nagaraja is the perfect game for you!"
1299,"In Balloon Cup, the players compete in several short balloon flights (hops) to collect the colored cubes associated with each hop."
1299,"Four landscape cards – two plains alternating with two mountains – are laid out, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 cubes in assorted colors (gray, blue, green, yellow, red) are added to these cards."
1299,"From a hand of eight balloon cards, you must try to pass each landscape by adding cards matching the colored blocks onto their side of table, although winds (and cunning) may occasionally cause them to play on their opponent's side – a move that can really ruin the opponent's plans."
1299,"High-valued balloons are played on the mountains, and low-valued balloons are played on the plains."
1299,"Whoever is the better balloonist takes the cubes from the card, which is then flipped over – mountains becomes plains and vice-versa – and refilled with cubes."
1299,Five trophy cards of value 3 to 7 are placed at the top of the cards.
1299,"When a player has collected enough cubes of a given color, he earns the trophy card for that color."
1299,Players may even trade three otherwise useless cubes for one they can use.
1299,The first player to earn three trophy cards is the winner!
1300,"Players are dealt a hand of 12 from a deck of 1-60 (the remainder go back in the box for the whole game), and then lay out marker cards that show the other players the strength of their hand."
1300,Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.
1300,Players choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously.
1300,"The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you."
1300,The second highest takes the other card likewise.
1300,Remaining cards are discounted.
1300,Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over!
1300,(The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers).
1300,"At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers)."
1300,There is a further twist!
1300,"Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise."
1300,"So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor!"
1300,Are you smarter?
1300,Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had?
1300,Play out rounds until all players have had each hand.
1300,Top score wins.
1301,Humanity has been at each other's throats since time immemorial.
1301,Now in another galaxy humans wage war amongst themselves again but this time with the aid of alien technology found on other planets.
1301,Ascending Empires offers a nice mixture of building exploring and development along with combat via a simple dexterity element.
1301,Ascending Empires is sure to sate the desire for a space empire building game that plays simply yet deeply.
1301,The last survivors of the Human race have fled to a new galaxy in fear of annihilation at the hands of an unstoppable enemy.
1301,"Now, having discovered the ruins of four long dead civilizations spread across the stars, the race to develop technology based on the alien relics has begun."
1301,Humans will once again ascend to the stars to claim the galaxy.
1301,"Players will colonize new worlds by building colonies, cities, and research facilities."
1301,"They will develop new Technologies, and build up fleets of Starships."
1301,"Ascending Empires is a fast paced game that utilizes a dexterity based Starship movement and combat system, and allows for many different strategies to be explored."
1302,Cooperation is key in Cahoots!
1302,Play cards to one of four piles by matching color or number.
1302,Work together as a team to complete a series of goals — without communicating what's in your hand.
1302,Can you make all piles purple or green?
1302,Every card lower than four?
1302,All cards add up to ten?
1302,There's only one way to win before time runs out: Play in cahoots!
1302,"Note that the original Cahoots has a player count of 2-4, while Tippi Toppi (Schmidt Spiele's licensed version of the game) has a player count of 1-4."
1302,"Notes a Schmidt editor: ""It is works quite well as a solo game, too."""
1302,Not to be confused with the other Cahoots game released in 2018.
1303,"Galaxy Defenders is a sci-fi cooperative, tactical battle game in which 1-5 players fight together against an oncoming alien menace."
1303,Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion.
1303,"Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice."
1303,Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn.
1303,Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn.
1303,"Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round."
1303,"Players may choose up to five agents:

Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies."
1303,Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service.
1303,He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones.
1303,Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent.
1303,This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows.
1303,She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.
1303,Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat.
1303,The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.
1303,"Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower."
1303,"There is no ""Alien player"" in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:

Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities."
1303,"Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate."
1303,The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players.
1303,"Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play."
1303,"If agents die during the game, the system ""recalibrates"" the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission."
1303,The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign.
1303,"Mission events influence future games in two different ways:

Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story."
1303,The agents gain experience during the missions.
1303,"This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology."
1303,"With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents."
1303,"To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new ""alien signals"" that can be teleported onto the battlefield."
1303,"This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign of Galaxy Defenders."
1303,Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.
1304,Edge of Darkness is the third Card Crafting Game from Alderac Entertainment Group designed by John D. Clair.
1304,"Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style board game of 60 to 120 minutes for 1 to 4 players."
1304,Players are the heads of powerful guilds in the City.
1304,Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the City in a desperate struggle against great evil.
1304,But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.
1304,The Guilds exert their control in the city by sending agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions.
1304,Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of the City.
1304,Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to the City's infrastructure.
1304,To win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends.
1304,"Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the City such as defending it from external and internal threats."
1304,"Here are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:

 Card Crafting: Similar to the original card-crafting game, Mystic Vale, all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on one third (1/3) of the slip and are transparent on the other two thirds (2/3)."
1304,"During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense)."
1304,"However, unlike Mystic Vale, the transparent cards are double-sided, and when you upgrade the ""good"" side of the cards (front), you also add strength to the ""bad"" side of the cards (back)."
1304,"Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: Rather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to."
1304,Different players will have the allegiance of different cards in that deck.
1304,Using other players' cards means you have to pay them.
1304,During the game you can claim allegiance of more cards in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal.
1304,"Card-driven worker placement: While your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost."
1304,"Advancements don't have a cost, instead they require the use of workers to a greater or lesser degree depending on the power of the card."
1304,e.g.
1304,many effects require placing or pulling workers from different city locations as dictated by the card effects.
1304,"Since you have a limited number of workers to use, you will constantly be choosing to forgo one useful thing in order to do another."
1304,Threat Tower:  There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and whom Threats will attack.
1304,"Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Threat Board, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn."
1304,"These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes of a given color accumulate on a card, it attacks the City."
1304,"If the color matches one of the players, it attacks that player."
1304,"If the color is black, it attacks all players!"
1304,Modular set up: Edge of Darkness will come with 12 Locations.
1304,"Each game you use only 10 of these Locations, which can be specifically selected or chosen randomly, making for a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you will need to employ."
1304,These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Crafting Slips.
1304,"Location Boards may specify special rules for worker placement, or extend the basic rules with all new systems."
1304,"For example, a combination of Location Boards can be used to assemble a party of heroes to take the fight to the Threat Tower and engage in a Monster Hunt!"
1305,In Amyitis the players are rival architects competing to earn the most prestige building one of the seven wonders of the ancient world: the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
1305,"The game is named after the daughter (or granddaughter) of Cyaxares, the king of the Medes, who married King Nebuchadnezzar II, ruler of Babylon."
1305,"The myth says that Amytis' homesickness for the forested mountains of the Median Empire led to the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as Nebuchadnezzar attempted to please her by planting the trees and plants of her homeland."
1305,The players embody noble Babylonians in quest of prestige.
1305,"All along the game, they strive to raise their status by building gardens and their irrigation network, and by trading and recruiting."
1305,"At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige is the winner."
1305,"In this game the players compete to build gardens, acquire plants, hire craftsmen, build irrigation and trade with ancient cities."
1305,Points can also be gained from building your palace and controlling the temples.
1305,"On a turn the players chose one of the following actions: a) Recruit a craftsman, that grants an action (priest on temple, resource, irrigation or camel) b) Move the caravan (to purchase plant or court card or trade) c) Pass to potentially gain income."
1305,It is an interactive game where a player's actions directly affect the other players.
1306,"The ""Arte di Calimala"" — the guild of cloth finishers and merchants in foreign cloth — was one of the greater guilds of Florence, who arrogated to themselves the civic power of the Republic of Florence during the Late Middle Ages."
1306,The woolen cloth trade was the engine that drove the city’s economy and the members of the Calimala were the elite of Florence.
1306,"Throughout its long history, the Arte di Calimala supervised the execution of artistic and architectural works."
1306,"Most Florentine guilds performed such activities, but the Calimala distinguished itself from other guilds through the number and prestige of the projects and the sites administered, including the construction and decoration of some of the major churches of the city."
1306,"Players of Calimala are cloth merchants in medieval Florence, with a number of trusted employees that they assign to various streets within the city to carry out actions."
1306,(Each street connects two places where particular actions can be taken.)
1306,"While taking these actions, players produce and deliver cloth and contribute to the construction and decoration of various buildings across the city."
1306,"Employees stay on their assigned places for a while, carrying out their actions whenever the street is activated, and eventually are promoted into the city council, triggering a scoring phase."
1306,"Depending on the number of players, each player has a number of action discs."
1306,"In turn order, they can put one on a space between two actions, performing both actions and activating all other discs on the same space."
1306,"When the fourth disc is placed on an action space, the lowest one is promoted to the city council, which triggers a scoring."
1306,"After the last action disc is placed or the last scoring phase in the council is triggered, the game ends."
1306,"The positions of the action spaces and sequence of scoring phases vary from game to game, making each game very different."
1306,Secret scoring objectives and action cards add uncertainty.
1307,You are a VIRUS that has just infected a human body.
1307,Now you have to spread out and mutate your virus in order to infect other organs to gain VIRAL POINTS.
1307,But watch out for the other VIRUS controlled by other players and the powerful IMMUNE SYSTEM!
1307,VIRAL is a 2-5 players competitive boardgame in which each player controls a virus that is growing inside a human body.
1307,Players will simultaneously play cards to place tokens on the board and move them around to gain control of zones to score Viral Points.
1307,"Players also score points when they cause a crisis in an organ, thus activating the anti-virus (the immune system)."
1307,Players also can play cards that allows them to attack other players.
1307,The player with the most Viral Points when the event deck runs out is the winner of the game VIRAL!
1308,"Redevelopment of Lost Cities, first published with altered rules as Keltis, and then published by Rio Grande as Lost Cities: The Board Game with Knizia's original rules and theme."
1308,"Reiner Knizia:  ""The original version that we developed is exactly what Jay [Tummelson, owner of Rio Grande Games] has now published [LCBG]""  

Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:
1."
1308,"In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect."
1308,(Normal scoring occurs each round.)
1308,"In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round."
1308,"This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected."
1308,2.
1308,"In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high."
1308,"In LCBG, you must play in ascending order."
1308,"Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above."
1308,Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.
1308,Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.
1308,Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series.
1308,"There are more differences, which are non-substantive."
1308,"Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor."
1308,Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition.
1308,"The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins."
1308,"From the Keltis entry:
Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths."
1308,"There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each)."
1308,"In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending."
1308,"Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones."
1308,"The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one."
1308,He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path.
1308,"Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points."
1308,The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths.
1308,"Now, scoring happens:

 Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2)."
1308,"Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10)."
1308,One piece of each player is higher and scores double.
1308,"Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)
 5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points."
1308,All this is added to the points scored during the game
1309,"Formerly titled, ""V-Commandos"", now renamed, ""V-Sabotage""."
1309,Victory depends on you!
1309,V-Commandos is a WW2 commandos co-operative board game.
1309,"Players can either select a pre-generated mission or create their own by combining objective cards, then they assemble a team from famous Allied corps: U.S."
1309,"Raiders, British SAS., Devil’s Brigade, SOE, etc."
1309,"During play, you hide in darkness, wear enemy uniforms, and sneak up on your targets."
1309,Get spotted?
1309,Open fire with emblematic allied weapons and try to turn the enemy's weapons against them!
1309,"If you can, get back to cover and turn off the alarms as the enemy has more available troops than you."
1309,"Thus, you need to focus on completing the mission, then leaving the area as quickly as you can."
1310,"In CODEX Naturalis, you must continue the work of the illuminating monk Tybor Kwelein, assembling the pages of a manuscript that lists the living species in primary forests."
1310,Can you put the pages together in the best order possible?
1310,And are you prepared to sacrifice a species to develop your manuscript?
1310,"In the game, each player starts with a single card on the table, a card that shows some combination of the four possible resources in the middle of the card, in the corners of the card, or both."
1310,"Players also have two resource cards and one gold card in hand, while two of each type of card are visible on the table."
1310,"On a turn, you place a card from your hand overlapping the corners of one or more cards you already have in play."
1310,"Your starting card has four overlappable corners, while resource and gold cards have only three."
1310,"Resource cards have no cost to be played, and they often depict resource symbols in their corners."
1310,"Gold cards deliver points when played, but they often have a resource requirement, e.g., three fungi or two plant/one animal/one insect, and you must have those resources visible in your manuscript at the time you play the gold card."
1310,"You score points from this card immediately, with some cards having a fixed value and others a variable one depending on how many of a certain symbol are showing or how many corners you covered this turn."
1310,"If you wish, you can play a card from your hand face down; such a card has four corners and one resource, but provides no points."
1310,"After you play, draw a face-up card or the top card of either deck to refill your hand."
1310,"When a player reaches 20 points, you complete the round, and each player takes one additional turn."
1310,"Players then score points based on how well they matched two public objective cards and one secret objective card, after which the player with the most points wins."
1311,"Game description from the publisher:
An age of innovation and discovery is at hand."
1311,"With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!"
1311,Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players.
1311,"Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict."
1311,"Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios."
1311,"The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together."
1311,"Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck."
1311,"The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn."
1311,Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards.
1311,"At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions."
1311,Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities.
1311,"These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards."
1311,"While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design."
1311,Will you create brutal deck of formidable Units?
1311,Or will you rely on Gold and Influence to acquire neutral forces and powerful Tactics?

GAME SYSTEM



 This entry is to allow for discussion/rating of the game system as a whole."
1312,It is not for a specific product or release.
1312,Versions will appear on the individual item pages.
1312,Unmatched is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players.
1312,Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend.
1312,"Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups."
1312,Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards.
1312,"However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time."
1312,The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhäuser for ranged attacks and area effects.
1312,—description from the publisher
1313,Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs.
1313,"Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare."
1313,The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions – younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding.
1313,"In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots."
1313,"VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games)."
1313,"It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn’t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand."
1313,It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game – VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.
1313,"Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all."
1313,Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their “prey”) and defends against the player on their right (their “predator”).
1313,"You gain victory points by eliminating or “ousting” your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey."
1313,The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!).
1313,This arrangement makes the game a very social one – you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies.
1313,"But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you’ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat."
1313,VTES is also a resource management game.
1313,Each player begins with 30 points of influence called “pool” that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself.
1313,"If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game."
1313,But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause.
1313,Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire.
1313,"Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish."
1313,"Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers."
1313,"Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool – spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted."
1313,Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.

1314,Individual battles between famous Star Wars characters set on different board locations.
1314,Players choose a major character that is accompanied by one or two minor characters.
1314,"Each set of characters has its own deck of cards which are used for attack, defense, or special abilities."
1314,Each deck is unique with certain special powers relevant to the major character.
1314,"There are different modes of play; one-on-one battles, up to three teams can play against each other, or up to six players can play a free-for-all battle."
1314,"Battle fields included are Geonosis Arena, Emperor's Throne Room, Carbon-Freezing Chamber, and Kamino Platform."
1314,"The game includes 31 decorated figures from across the entire Star Wars spectrum, 12 character cards (which have major and minor character life trackers on them), 378 action cards (31 per character group), 4 battle field boards, 1 movement die, wound markers, and rules."
1315,Who are you in Mascarade?
1315,Whoever you want to be...at least until someone else calls you out on it!
1315,"Each character receives a face-down role card at the start of the game, and in a game with 4-5 players some role cards are placed in the center of the table."
1315,"On a turn, you take one of three actions:
1) Announce your character: Claim the power of a certain character and take the associated action."
1315,"You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal."
1315,"2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself."
1315,"You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark."
1315,3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.
1315,"Play continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins — or until a player has lost all of their coins, in which case the player with the most coins wins."
1315,"Mascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game."
1315,"The rules suggest that you use certain characters in your first games, but once you know the game, you can try many other distributions."
1316,"In the DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Heroes Unite, each player takes on the role of a Super Hero such as Shazam!, Hawkman, Red Tornado, Nightwing, Black Canary, Batgirl, or Booster Gold."
1316,Your Super Hero has an ability that will guide your strategy throughout the game.
1316,Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn.
1316,"Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck."
1316,"There are five different types of cards that can be acquired: Villains, Heroes, Equipment, Super Powers, and Locations."
1316,"Unlock special abilities, like Force Field or the Helmet of Fate, and unleash devastating card combos against your opponents!"

1317,"In the two-player, co-operative trick-taking game The Fox in the Forest Duet, players team up, helping each other move through the forest."
1317,"Collect all the gems before the end of three rounds of play, and you win!"
1317,"To set up the game, place gem tokens on the designated spaces of the game board and the team tracker token in the center of the movement path."
1317,"At the start of each round, shuffle the deck of thirty cards — which contains three suits, each numbered 1-10 — and deal each player a hand of eleven cards."
1317,"Reveal one card as the ""decree"" card to determine the trump suit."
1317,"For each trick, one player leads a card, and the other must follow suit, if possible."
1317,The winner of the trick moves the team tracker toward them a number of spaces equal to the number of fox footprints on the cards played.
1317,"If the tracker lands on a space next to a gem, the players collect one gem."
1317,"If the tracker would move off the end of the path, return the tracker to the center of the path, then add a forest token to one end of the path, reducing the number of spaces upon which you can move (with you sliding gems next to this covered space next to the new end of the path)."
1317,"The odd-numbered character cards have special abilities when played, allowing the trick winner to move the tracker in the direction of their choice or to ignore the footprints on one of the played cards so that you can land on just the right spot."
1317,"One character allows players to exchange one card with each other, while another allows a player to change the decree card."
1317,"At the end of a round, you add five gems to designated spaces, add a forest space to shorten the path, then receive a new hand of eleven cards from a freshly shuffled deck."
1317,"Collect all 22 gem tokens, and you win."
1317,"Run out of time or head off the end of the path with no forest spaces in reserve, then you can just keep running in defeat or shuffle the cards and start the game anew."
1318,The year is 1822.
1318,"After years of decay, it is time to rebuild the medina, located at the foot of the Atlas mountains."
1318,The architects and engineers of the city work to erect large and beautiful palaces and to renovate the damaged city wall.
1318,"As the reconstruction of the old city progresses, the city's inhabitants flock through the alleys, and the contours of the new city gradually reappear!"
1318,"Each turn, players must place two pieces on the board (except when allowed to skip this with a tea tile), either augmenting an existing building (or starting a new building if the current building of that color is finished), or expanding one of the other features of the city, like the market or the walls."
1318,"Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to the building."
1318,"Also, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a bonus for that color."
1318,"Finally, there are bonuses for palaces around the well, as well as for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city."
1318,Medina is a tense game by the great designer Stefan Dorra.
1318,"This latest edition of the game features a double-sided game board (enabling a two-player game), almost 200 detailed wooden pieces, and updated gameplay, as well as rules and components never before published for this game!"

1319,"Build gigantic monuments, raise impenetrable fortifications, and amass vast knowledge as the ages pass."
1319,The greatest civilizations will leave their mark long after their collapse.
1319,"From times long forgotten to times recently lost, civilizations will rise and fall as the tide of time carries them."
1319,Tides of Time is a drafting game for two players.
1319,Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom.
1319,Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective.
1319,"After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score."
1319,"Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a ""relic of the past"" to help them in later rounds."
1319,"After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins."
1320,"In an abandoned warehouse a gangster band is splitting its loot, but they can’t get an agreement on the split!"
1320,It’s time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone.
1320,The richest surviving gangster wins the game!
1320,Ca$h 'n Gun$ will make you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies.
1320,"Fun, bluffing, and tough negotiations are guaranteed, but will you dare to play?"
1320,It's simply killing!
1320,"On each turn, a player will assume the role of ""The Don"", and will call out the steps in gameplay."
1320,"Before the skirmish itself, an available pot of cash will be laid out before the players."
1320,This pot must be evenly split up amongst all of the surviving hoods.
1320,"After that, the ""Don"" of the round will ask the players, including himself, to load their guns (in the form of selecting one of three possible cards: ""Bang!"
1320,""", ""Bang!"
1320,Bang!
1320,"Bang!"""
1320,"or ""Click!"
1320,"Click!"""
1320,"from a set of 8 cards: 2 ""Bang!"
1320,"""s, 1 Triple-""Bang!"""
1320,"and 5 ""Clicks!"
1320,"""), and then count down to all of the players aiming their guns (real foam guns)."
1320,"Each player will then take a look at how many guns are pointed at them, and also take a look at the available pot of cash for the round before deciding if they want to ""Chicken Out"" and remove themselves from the skirmish."
1320,"If they choose to back down, they will get a ""Chicken"" token which will deduct from their ill-gotten gains at the end of the game."
1320,"But all players have to ""Chicken Out"" at the same time, using a countdown like the aiming."
1320,The remaining players will resolve the shootout showing their cards.
1320,"First, all Triple-""Bangs!"""
1320,wound the players they are aimed at.
1320,"If there are still-aiming players with ""Bang!"""
1320,"cards, those now wound their targets."
1320,"""Click!"
1320,"""s are only bluffs and do nothing."
1320,A player that is wounded during the standoff does not participate in the split of the cash and receives a bandage (any player that receives a certain number of bandages is eliminated from the game).
1320,"Now all the used cards are discarded--even those of the players that ""Chickened Out""."
1320,Now the remaining players will finally split the cash.
1320,"If the cash cannot be divided evenly, the rest is kept on the table and is added to the new pot."
1320,"The game is played 8 rounds, until all cards were played."
1320,"Keeping track of the cards is important, since all players have only a limited supply of ""real"" shots."
1320,"There are a couple of expansions packed-in with most editions that change some of the mechanics of the game, and also add a new ""traitor""-based mechanic, as well."
1321,"Italy, late Middle Ages."
1321,The fabric merchants need to write down their contracts in a language that everyone can understand and the literates are looking for an alternative to the elite of the traditional Latin language.
1321,"So, the Volgare, the language spoken by the common people, taken from the dialects spoken in the various Italian regions, starts to gain relevance."
1321,"During this period, Francesco D’Assisi writes his famous Canticle of the Sun and Dante writes the Divine Comedy, both written in Volgare."
1321,The players will have to do their part in the creation of this new language!
1321,But who will provide them the proper knowledge to understand the manuscripts in the different dialects?
1321,Who will succeed to uncover the secrets of the books inside the Papal Library?
1321,Who will embrace the religious life and who will remain a merchant?
1321,"Some of the players can become a famous banker, someone else can climb the church’s hierarchy to be the next Pope!"
1321,"But in the end, who will be the most appreciated and respected for his status and his culture?"
1321,The aim of the game is to obtain more Volgare points.
1321,"The players will gain VP from reading manuscripts, looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or ""The Riddle from Verona""."
1321,"Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope."
1321,"Moreover, VP can be gotten with money and with the support of Politicians, Noblemen, Abbesses, and the Amanuensis."
1322,"Aeon’s End: Outcasts continues the Expedition system that was introduced in Aeon’s End: New Age, which allows players to replay all of the content they own in a short campaign format."

1322,"However, the nemeses that players will face grow stronger and stronger with each battle."

1323,"Several millennia ago, the tiny planet Solenia lost its day-and-night cycle: Its northern hemisphere is forever plunged into darkness, and its southern hemisphere is eternally bathed in sunlight."
1323,Your mission is to carry on your ancestors' honorable task of traveling the world to deliver essential goods to the inhabitants of both hemispheres.
1323,"While the Day people want you to deliver the rarest gems and stones, the Night people sorely need wood and wheat to survive."
1323,Be efficient and outpace your opponents to collect the most gold stars by the end of the game!
1323,"A game of Solenia plays out over 16 rounds, and in each round, each player plays one card from their hand onto an empty space of the 5x5 game board."
1323,"You can play the card on either:

A floating production island, to gain as many resources as the value of the card you played of the type corresponding to this space
A floating city, to fulfill a delivery tile by delivering the resources depicted on it."
1323,You must play your card adjacent to the airship in the center of the playing area or adjacent to another card of yours already played.
1323,"When someone plays a 0 card, the airship advances one space, then at the end of your turn, you remove the back edge of the board, give players resources based on the cards they have on this strip of the playing area, flip the strip over (turning night to day or dawn to dusk or vice versa), and place it on the other side of the game board."
1323,The game ends when each player has played all 16 of their cards.
1323,The player with the most gold stars wins!

1324,Le Havre: The Inland Port is a two-player game in which both players compete to become the richest harbormaster.
1324,How they do so?
1324,"Players acquire resources, construct buildings and, after twelve rounds, score the total value of their buildings and their money in cash."
1324,"Each round, a set of new, predefined buildings is added to the market."
1324,Both players now take turns by either building one of these buildings or by using an existing building's effects.
1324,"To construct a building, players have to pay a certain amount of money and/or resources from their warehouse."
1324,"Most of these buildings, in turn, allow to change the amount of resources on a player's warehouse board in a specific way when used."
1324,This is crucial to the game as players are restricted on how to fill or empty their warehouse.
1324,They have to combine and optimize these steps to max out the capacity of their warehouses.
1324,"Players can even use their opponent's buildings, but they have to pay them one Franc (=money) to do so."
1324,"When a building is not used during a round, it steadily increases in worth as its effects can be used up to four times in subsequent rounds."
1324,But a building that is not used for too long has to be sold to the market for half its value!
1324,The game uses an Ora et Labora-like wheel to track this status of each building in play.
1324,"Although Le Havre: The Inland Port shares gameplay elements with Ora et Labora and is linked in theme with Le Havre, it is a distinct game with its own mechanisms and gameplay."
1325,"The king lies near death, so the princes compete to dominate the kingdom and secure the throne by grabbing as much land as possible."
1325,"This is, in the ideal, a 4 player game."
1325,Each turn a card is revealed that displays 3 actions that players can choose from.
1325,"Each player in turn choose an action by playing a 1, 2 or 3 card identifying the first, second or third action on the revealed card."
1325,The beauty of this mechanism lies in the distribution of 3 actions among 4 players.
1325,Someone always misses out.
1325,"If two players choose the same action (and this is often, decided by the last player as the first 3 often - not always - but often  choose actions a1, 2 and 3) the players who chose it negotiate a solution."
1325,If they cannot come to an agreement they duel.
1325,"This is one of the defining elements of the game, but can take some time (negotiations can) and so was dropped from the re-implementation as Domaine."
1325,The game board is built of 6 tiles randomly placed in a frame producing a slightly different game each time.
1325,"It is seen by many as the third in a Teuber thematic trilogy defined by Entdecker, Catan, Löwenherz."
1325,The board is conflicted and in the manner of Go the idea is to capture as much territory as possible.
1325,"Each player starts with three castles (12 across all four players, and a crowded board)."
1325,"They build walls to create kingdoms, and train knights to defend them, both key actions on that action card they bid on each turn."
1325,Consequently this is a high conflict area grabbing game with a heavy element of negotiation.
1326,Players take turns choosing blocks and giving them to each other to place on their structure.
1326,A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.
1326,"When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game."
1326,Last player standing wins.
1326,"Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):
Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack."
1326,Each player is given a base block and a number of beans.
1326,"During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction."
1326,All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower.
1326,If your tower falls you are out of the game.
1326,The last tower standing wins.
1326,"Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):
There are five variations on how to play."
1326,The goal in all of them is to build a tower.
1326,The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e.
1326,"an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.)"
1326,"as well as a sack of beans for the ""auction variation"" of the game."
1326,"Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together."
1326,"The ""auction variations"" are the most suspenseful and surprising."
1326,One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element.
1326,Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills.
1326,It's a game with almost endless building possibilities.
1326,It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.
1327,"In La Cosa Nostra, you take on the role of a mafia boss."
1327,"In the beginning, you control a crew of gangsters and a couple of businesses."
1327,"During the game, you will hire new gangsters to do the dirty work and collect your money."
1327,"Investments lead to new lines of business or monopoly positions: take control of the drug dealing, moneylending or prostitution."
1327,"Bribe politicians and cops, invest your money in night clubs, casinos or the waste management industry."
1327,"To get the big deals, you need to cooperate with the other families — but never rely on those ""friendships""."
1327,"The others will take the first opportunity to stab you in the back, so you better do it first...
Each player controls gangster cards that serve to either gain money or attack other players."
1327,"Actions are planned secretly, placed face down, then played in turn."
1327,Often you need certain business cards to succeed.
1327,"If you don't own them yourself, you can negotiate deals with the other players."
1327,"The players bargain, spy, threaten, and deceive each other."
1327,"Each of the four rounds brings new action cards into the game, and the number of gangsters increases."
1327,"Thus, the possibilities for actions become more diverse, the jobs more profitable, and the attacks more powerful."
1327,Co-operation gets more attractive and treason alluring because at the end of the day money is the only thing that counts.
1328,Meuterer is a role selection card game in which players take the roles of crewmembers aboard a merchant ship.
1328,"Each round, each player reveals goods from their hands that they wish to sell."
1328,"However, most ports deal in only one sort of good, and only the captain may decide where the ship goes."
1328,"If a player chooses to become the mutineer, he/she will try to become captain in order to change the destination of the ship."
1328,"Each player may also have an ally in the fight, and the side which played the most conflict points gets the final word on the ship's destination."
1328,The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.
1328,"Every time a player sells more goods than the other players or reaches their destination, they score points."
1328,Allies to a mutiny also get points.
1329,The forest is growing fast!
1329,"As caretakers for Kodama, the tree spirits, you must keep the forest a healthy and lush home for your little friends."
1329,"Over three growing seasons, you must cultivate trees with the right mix of flowers, insects, and branch arrangements to make your Kodama as happy as possible."
1329,Whoever cares for their Kodama best will be remembered for generations!
1329,"From the designer of the hit game Kigi, Kodama: The Tree Spirits branches out into a fun new way to play!"
1329,"Grow your tree by placing cards in clever arrangements, being careful to leave room for future growth."
1329,"At the end of each season, one Kodama will award you points for how well your tree suits its needs."
1329,"With beautiful art and innovative mechanics, Kodama is an inTREEguing game for the whole family."
1330,"In Pickomino, two to seven players, ages 8 and up try to obtain fried worms for their chickens, so that they don't go hungry."
1330,"Of course, anyone who doesn't manage to grab a worm off of the grill can help himself to those of his opponents."
1330,"This fast-paced game by Reiner Knizia is, like Hick Hack im Gackelwack, a gambling game in the finest chicken tradition."""
1330,Each turn players roll their dice and set aside all those matching any single value.
1330,The remaining dice are rolled and any value is set aside again until the player stops and takes a tile or busts and puts their last tile back.
1330,When a player busts and fails to take a tile they must also turn the highest tile face-down.
1330,"Interestingly, the German edition from Zoch has English rules in the box."
1330,"The Dutch edition is part of the Jakkie & Bak Collection
The German edition is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch."
1331,"Rome is in a state of emergency, the Senate and the Guard are embroiled in fierce arguments, the people are divided."
1331,"Many roads lead to Rome, whether you decide to use powerful cards such as the Tower and the Praetorian Guard to protect the power and victory points you have, or instead prefer to use the Consul and the Tribune to skilfully pull the strings behind the scenes."
1331,Whoever succeeds in using their connections and manages to play their cards cleverly will at the end deserve their victor's laurels.
1331,Roma features unique card and dice play.
1331,"Players place cards at ""dice stations"" numbered 1-6."
1331,The player uses dice rolled each turn to activate dice stations to use the card that has been placed at a station.
1331,"Card effects guide your tactical actions in the game through manipulating cards in play, providing money or granting victory points."
1331,"In each game of Roma, there are a fixed amount of victory points in play, once all victory points have been collected, the player who has the most victory points wins the game."
1331,"Can be combined with its sequel game, Arena: Roma II, with varying play options."
1331,"Integrates with:

 Arena: Roma II"

1334,The abstract strategy game Quoridor is surprisingly deep for its simple rules.
1334,The object of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board.
1334,On your turn you may either move your pawn or place a wall.
1334,"You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not completely block them off."
1334,"Meanwhile, they are trying to do the same to you."
1334,The first pawn to reach the opposite side wins.
1335,The Capo is getting old and about to retire.

1335,"Maybe it's time for you to make your moves from behind the scenes, to put the gangsters into play that support your goals."
1335,Will you gain the most respect?
1335,Nothing Personal is a game for 3-5 players.
1335,"Players attempt to gain the most respect in five turns (five years) by amassing respect amongst the mafia through influence, negotiation, blackmail and bribery."
1335,Players take turns playing influence cards to take control of gangsters and work them up the chain of power.
1335,Each position and gangster has their own special abilities that give players the edge they need to accrue the respect they deserve - to become the Boss of Bosses.
1336,"In the game Rumis, the players construct an Inca building with their stones."
1336,"All players receive three-dimensional pieces made of wood or plastic, which they will try to position adjacent to already placed pieces of their own color."
1336,"All of their own pieces are of different shapes, which is a challenge to the three-dimensional imagination."
1336,"Cubic, wedge-shaped, or pyramidal volumes are different building limitations, which are imposed by the various building scenarios."
1336,"Playing RUMIS, you will find that no game is similar to any previous one."
1336,"Once your mind has mastered the puzzling shapes of the RUMIS pieces, you will explore the depth of tactical and strategic possibilities offered."
1336,"The rebrand by Educational Insights is labelled 1 to 4 players on the box, adding solitaire puzzles such as building a 3x3 cube with one color and building the various shapes using all the colors, following the rules of the multiplayer games while leaving no gaps in the structure."
1336,"Expanded by:

1337,"In Haspelknecht: The Story of Early Coal Mining, the first title in Thomas Spitzer's highly acclaimed Coal Trilogy, the players take upon the role of farmers with opportunities to exploit the presence of coal in their lands in the southern part of the Ruhr region of Germany."
1337,The game is set during a time when the lands were mostly covered with forests and roads were rare.
1337,"Coal was discovered here, close to the Earth's surface."
1337,"During the game, players obtain knowledge about this new material, extend their farms, and dig deeper in the ground to extract more coal."
1337,The game has many paths that lead to victory.
1337,Haspelknecht has an innovative action selection mechanism.
1337,"You must select the correct tasks while being mindful of quickly accumulating pit water, for it can stall your efforts and prevent your extraction of valuable coal."
1337,The game offers a lot of variation and replayability through unique methods in setting-up the development tiles.
1338,"Escape the Dark Castle is a simple, cooperative game of retro-atmospheric adventure."
1338,"Players take on the roles of prisoners, wrongfully incarcerated in the depths of The Dark Castle."
1338,"Whether it’s the Abbot, the Tailor or any of the six playable characters, each prisoner is represented by a character card and a custom character die showing that prisoner’s unique endowment of Might, Cunning and Wisdom – the game’s three traits."
1338,"Embarking on a desperate quest to escape, the players must work together using custom dice and item cards to overcome the castle’s many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, illustrated chapter card."
1338,"At the beginning of each game, 15 of these chapter cards are drawn at random from a larger deck to create a unique castle every time."
1338,"Gameplay involves one player revealing a new chapter card each turn, in a motion like turning a page of a book."
1338,"When a card is turned, the next chamber or passageway into which the prisoners have stumbled is revealed."
1338,There is no turn order.
1338,"Instead, players decide as a group who will turn the next chapter card, and there are often grisly consequences for the one that does!"
1338,"Once revealed, the chapter card will explain the situation facing the group and what must be done to get through it."
1338,"In the style of choose-your-path adventures, most chapters offer the group a choice about how to proceed."
1338,Bribe the drunken guards or attack them?
1338,Charge the beast or lure it out?
1338,Steal from the kitchen stores or keep moving?
1338,"Each chapter is a mini-game and a variety of mechanics are required to complete it, from RPG-style skill tests for an individual character, to push-your-luck dice rolling as a team, to the playing of item cards collected along the way to bolster the tactical abilities of the group."
1338,"When the players choose to enter (or fail to avoid) combat, all players roll their unique character dice simultaneously to make an attack against the enemy."
1338,"They need to collectively muster the right combination of Might, Cunning and Wisdom to defeat the foe in question, or risk taking damage."
1338,"Blocking, Resting, and the use of Weapons, Relics and Potions will help to keep the prisoners alive."
1338,"The goal of the game is for the group to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss."
1338,"To win, they must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately."
1339,"More than one thousand items from all walks of life can be guessed through the use of 61 transparent cards in Imagine, whether they're placed next to one another or superimposed."
1339,Almost everything in the world can be represented by a simplified concept — just don't speak while you're playing...
1340,"After the immediate response to Richard Breese's Keydom at Essen 1999, Hans im Glück contracted to take the basic game idea and produce a version of the game."

1340,"The top part of the board is where players use treasure tokens to purchase artifacts, and the player who can collect the most artifacts by the end of the game will be the victor."

1341,A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo.
1341,"The game consists of a large number of politician cards, some of which form the first politburo."
1341,"Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age."
1341,"At the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least)."
1341,"Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo."
1341,Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question.
1341,"Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others."
1341,"But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years."
1341,"Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely)."
1341,"At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is)."
1341,A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.
1341,"The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance."
1341,The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.
1341,"Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box -See Kremlin (Third Edition)-:
1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia."
1341,This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.
1341,2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'.
1341,"Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians."
1341,"It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game
3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution."
1341,"This version introduces the concept of ""Going into Exile"" to avoid Siberia."
1341,"It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev."
1342,"Aftermath is an Adventure Book Game in which players take on the role of small critters struggling to survive and thrive in a big, dangerous world."
1342,"Humans have mysteriously vanished, and the remnants of civilization are quickly being reclaimed by nature and the animals who still remain."
1342,"In the game, you play as a misfit band of critters known by their colony as ""providers""."
1342,"There's the guinea pig with anger issues, a hamster that talks fast and drives faster, a small mouse with keen eyes and a lot to prove, and a mysterious vole who's borderline feral."
1342,"These characters each have their own personalities, play-styles, and personal goals."
1342,You'll leave the safety of your colony and venture out into the abandoned world on one of 20+ story-driven missions and side missions.
1342,"Scavenge the ruins of mankind in search of food and supplies for your colony, but beware — the world is filled with bandits and predators, and you must fight or flee to stay alive."
1342,Return to your colony with resources and information that will help your friends and family survive.
1342,"Grow your colony and keep it safe by building structures and improvements with the spoils of your adventures, but plan accordingly, for the colony will face hardship each time you leave it...

1343,"You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out – or you will remain trapped forever!"
1343,"You may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room."
1343,"In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth."
1343,Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game.
1343,"You (and a partner) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards."
1343,In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares.
1343,Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...
1343,"Basic Deck:

 8 Door cards - two each of red, blue, green and brown
 10 Nightmare cards
 58 Labyrinth cards:
 16 red chambers:     3 keys, 4 moons, 9 suns
 15 blue chambers:    3 keys, 4 moons, 8 suns
 14 green chambers:   3 keys, 4 moons, 7 suns
 13 brown chambers:   3 keys, 4 moons, 6 suns


Three mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the basic game:

""The Towers"" introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition."
1343,"""Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions"" adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies."
1343,"In ""The Book of Steps Lost and Found"", you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task."
1344,Ticket to Ride: Germany is a standalone game in the Ticket to Ride series.
1344,"Over the course of the game, players collect cards in order to then claim routes on the game board between two cities."
1344,Ideally the players create a network of routes that connect the cities showing on their secret ticket cards.
1344,"Players score points both for claiming routes and for completing tickets, with incomplete tickets counting against a player's score."
1344,"In addition to scoring points for tickets, whenever a player places a route on the board, they claim a passenger from the two cities that form the endpoints for that route (assuming that the passengers have not already been claimed)."
1344,"At the end of the game, whoever has the most passengers of each of the six colors scores 20 points for that color; whoever has the secondmost passengers in a color scores 10 points."
1344,Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.
1344,Ticket to Ride: Germany combines most of Zug um Zug: Deutschland and the Deutschland 1902 expansion in one box.
1344,"Zug um Zug: Deutschland, published solely for the German and Austrian market, consisted of the same map as Ticket to Ride: Märklin, but ZuZ:D didn't include the passenger mechanism from Märklin in which players scored additional points by moving passengers from city to city."
1344,"The Deutschland 1902 expansion introduced a different method of scoring passengers, and that method is now present in this collection."
1345,"The 2012 rerelease of Wallenstein tweaks the 2002 title from designer Dirk Henn and publisher Queen Games, while including two new expansions."
1345,The setting and game play of the two games are mostly the same.
1345,"In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves."
1345,"The game lasts two ""years,"" with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year."
1345,"After two years, the player with the most points – with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control – wins."
1345,"In each of the ""action"" seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down."
1345,"The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out."
1345,"Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile."
1345,"After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all."
1345,"Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt."
1345,Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.
1345,"Wallenstein includes two expansions: ""Emperor's Court,"" in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available."
1345,"""Landsknechte,"" which can be used with ""Emperor's Court"" or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order."
1345,"If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card."
1345,This stack resets after winter ends.
1345,"Note that the box of this game states is for 2-5 players, but the game actually plays only with 3-5 players."
1346,"Normandy, June 6th, 1944 – as you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies."
1346,You must do something!
1346,"In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest."
1346,Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else.
1346,"As the game progresses, they will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as their unit grows stronger and deadlier."
1346,They will succeed...or die trying.
1346,"D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive."
1346,It also includes solitaire optional rules.
1346,"Although built around dice rolling, this game is about resource management (soldiers, specialists, items and courage) and knowing when to move your unit."
1346,"Resources are kept from turn to turn, so the players can plan ahead."
1346,Note: This listing is for the commercial version of D-Day Dice.
1346,"To download and play the game now, go to D-Day Dice: Free Trial Version."

 The final in the three part series of starter kits for Advanced Squad Leader."
1347,The goal of these is to introduce the rules of the massive World War II wargame in more manageable pieces.
1347,"While the first focused on small infantry-only skirmishes, the second is based around confrontations involving infantry and the use of field ordnance, the third introduces the world of tanks and other fighting vehicles."
1347,"The box is a complete game, including rules (complete with updated rules from Advanced Squad Leader: Starter Kit #1 & Advanced Squad Leader: Starter Kit #2), counters, eight scenarios, (S20-S27) and three new maps (boards t, u, and v)."
1348,"The animals are dressed up and ready to enter the ""Beasty Bar"" nightclub."
1348,Who will actually make it through the door?
1348,"Beasty Bar is a fun ""take that"" card game about party animals."
1348,"The players play animal cards into a line, and each animal has a special power that can manipulate the order of the cards."
1348,"Whenever five animals are present at the end of a turn, the two animals up front get to party while the one at the rear has to go home."
1348,Whoever manages to send more of her animals to the party than anyone else wins.
1349,Antike II is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations.
1349,"Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology."
1349,Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies.
1349,Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided.
1349,"Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves."
1349,The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first wins the game!
1349,Lead one of these nations to victory—but watch out for your enemies as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples.
1349,"The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy."
1349,"Antike II differs from the 2005 Antike in several ways, according to designer Mac Gerdts."
1349,"To start, players now own city tokens, which allows them some degree of choice as to which resource a newly founded city shall produce."
1349,"Military units have become more expensive, and the rules for the conquest of cities are considerably easier."
1349,The scientific progresses were altered as well.
1349,"Neutral temples now exist, which may be destroyed, gaining VPs of a general, without harming other players."
1349,"The game features two new maps in a new graphical design, and a new card named ""BELLONA"" (the ancient Roman goddess of war) has been introduced to counter the starting player's advantage."
1349,"Gerdts notes that the main goal of all of these changes was to make the rules for a conquest of cities easier, while also opening more possibilities to win the game without the need to attack other players."
1350,CloudAge is a strategy game from Alexander Pfister and Arno Steinwender.
1350,The award-winning authors have created a dark and dystopian world for 1 to 4 players.
1350,"Fifteen years ago, the mysterious secret society ""Cloud"" set fire to countless oil production sites and burned down large forests to destabilize the world."
1350,The resulting environmental catastrophe had disastrous effects on the entire planet.
1350,"Now, years later, you travel above the dried-out landscape in your airships, searching for a better life."
1350,"You visit cities, send out drones to collect resources, and battle Cloud militia."
1350,"An innovative sleeving mechanism makes a new, more immersive, form of resource gathering possible."
1350,Players try to predict which cloud-covered terrain will contain the desired amount of resources or where additional actions are possible.
1350,Resources allow players to develop useful upgrades for their airships or attract new crew members.
1350,"CloudAge is a mix of engine-building, deck-building, and resource management."
1350,"The campaign system makes it easy to start playing quickly, with new elements being introduced into the game as players progress through the chapters."
1350,"While you play, you also experience and help guide the story."
1350,"If you prefer, you can also play standalone story spin-offs as single scenarios."
1350,—description from the publisher
1351,This game uses a collection of smallish hexagon clusters arranged in a circle.
1351,"Mercenaries, in the form of small wooden blocks, are placed onto the land pieces."
1351,"Players can then use these blocks to attempt to gain control of the corresponding mercenary type, or place the same small blocks onto the board which can help the player who controls that color."
1351,"Once a player has majority of control markers on a piece of land, he can build a tower there."
1351,"The tower serves as a semi-permanent control marker, as well as a way to win."
1351,"If two land pieces are controlled by the same player, the land pieces are combined into one, which makes the position harder to take by the other players."
1351,"The first player to place a set number of towers wins the game, but the game can also end when the land masses are reduced to three or fewer, in which case the player with the most towers placed wins."
1352,Tides of Madness is a sequel to Tides of Time and features gameplay similar to that design.
1352,Tides of Time is a drafting game for two players.
1352,Each game consists of three rounds in which players draft cards from their hands to build their kingdom.
1352,Each card is one of five suits and also has a scoring objective.
1352,"After all cards have been drafted for the round, players total their points based on the suits of cards they collected and the scoring objectives on each card, then they record their score."
1352,"Each round, the players each select one card to leave in their kingdom as a ""relic of the past"" to help them in later rounds."
1352,"After three rounds, the player with the the most prosperous kingdom wins."
1352,Tides of Madness adds a new twist to the above game: madness.
1352,"Some cards, while powerful, harm your psyche, so you must keep an eye on your madness level or else risk losing the game early as your mind is lost to the power of the ancients."
1352,"More specifically, eight of the eighteen cards in the game feature a madness icon, and while scoring, you receive a madness token for each such icon in your collection of cards."
1352,"Whoever has the most madness in a round either scores 4 points or discards 1 madness token — and the latter option is valuable because if you ever have nine or more madness, you lose the game immediately."
1353,"From the award-winning designer Bruno Cathala, Ishtar is a game in which you play the role of a gardener aiming to transform the dry desert into the Lost Hanging Gardens of Babylon."
1353,"To accomplish your mission, you will have to plant flowers, which, if you place them well, can help you gather precious gems and activate actions."
1353,"Whether to buy Trees (which will block the link between two Flower spots, as well as earning you points) or to purchase upgrades (such as getting two more points per Tree card at the end of the game), collecting gems will be a crucial part of the game."
1353,"Get them before your opponents, recruit apprentices, send them to earn points in the copses of flowers you have created, block others and think carefully of the upgrades to purchase if you want to become the best gardener at the end of the game!"
1353,—description from the publisher
1354,"The race is on for the robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory who work long, hard days at the assembly line building high‐speed supercars, but never get to see them in action."
1354,"On Saturday nights, the factory comes to life as the ultimate race course with treacherous obstacles and rival sabotage."
1354,"In Robo Rally, players move their robots through the course by speeding through corridors and dodging traps to reach each checkpoint first."
1354,Only the strongest robots survive!
1354,Enter the world of mad machines and dangerous schemes in the Robo Rally board game.
1354,Players control their robot with game cards which reveal directions on how the robots can move through the hectic Robo Rally automobile factory.
1354,Use strategy to outsmart rival robots while racing towards each checkpoint in your chosen course in numerical order.
1354,"Beware of factory obstacles such as industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts that can make or break the race."
1354,"The 2016 edition of Robo Rally differs from earlier versions in a number of ways:

Players each now have their own deck of twenty cards, with the same cards in each deck."
1354,"On a turn, a player draws nine cards from their deck, programs five of the cards, then discards the rest."
1354,"Two cards says ""Again"" and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says ""Energy"" and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options."
1354,"Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first."
1354,Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.
1354,"When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks."
1354,"""Normal"" damage from the board or a robot laser gives you ""spam"" damage."
1354,"When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck."
1354,Surprise!
1354,"Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage."
1354,"By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck."
1355,Wildcatters is a tactical and strategic board game set during the booming business of the 19th century oil industry!

1355,Your goal is to deliver more oil barrels to the continents than the other players while also collecting more shares and money than them.
1355,"The game lasts seven rounds with four players, and the game set-up is the same for each player, with three rigs, two trains, one tanker and one refinery being placed on the board."
1355,The game board features a world map divided into eight areas where you can find oil.
1355,"Players choose an open area card and get money to build rigs, tankers, trains and refineries, after which they can buy oil actions."
1355,The players work together in an oilfield to find oil at a lower cost.
1355,"The players transport oil together to the refineries, using trains and tankers from other players to deliver oil to the refineries – and all with one purpose: deliver more oil than the other players by the end of the game."
1356,"In Yukon Airways, you will be at the controls of your very own seaplane with the mission of transporting travelers to the different points of the Yukon."
1356,Embark your passengers (dice) using a draft system and use your ticket cards to take them to the different locations on the map.
1356,"For each passenger, you get money and the possibility of improving your plane if the passenger finds a point of interest that satisfies their tastes at the destination (when the color of the die matches the color of one of the cubes at that destination)."

1357,-description from publisher
1358,It's the early 20th century.
1358,You have decided to sail back to the newly discovered seventh continent to attempt to lift the terrible curse that has struck you since your return from the previous expedition.
1358,"In The 7th Continent, a solo or cooperative ""choose-your-own-adventure"" exploration board game, you choose a character and begin your adventure on your own or with a team of other explorers."
1358,"Inspired by the Fighting Fantasy book series, you will discover the extent of this wild new land through a variety of terrain and event cards."
1358,"In a land fraught with danger and wonders, you have to use every ounce of wit and cunning to survive, crafting tools, weapons, and shelter to ensure your survival."
1358,"Unlike most board games, it will take you many, MANY hours of exploring and searching the seventh continent until you eventually discover how to remove the curse(s)... or die trying."
1358,"Fortunately, The 7th Continent features an easy saving system so that you can stop playing at any time and resume your adventure later on, just like in a video game!"
1358,"The ""Classic Edition"" includes 3 curses for players to face – “The Voracious Goddess”, “An offering to the Guardians”, “The Bloody Hunt” – and contains 849 cards, 2 storage trays, 34 dividers, 9 cardboard figures with plastic stands, 8 dice, a 24-page rule booklet and 1 player aid."
1358,"It differs from the “Collector Edition” of The 7th Continent, that was available via Serious Poulp's two successful Kickstarter campaigns, in that it lacks all of Kickstarter exclusives (1 curse, 2 characters, 113 adventure cards, and component upgrades such as the plastic figures, discard pile holder and magnifying glass)."
1359,"Take on the role of one of the great monarchs of the past, and show your valor!"
1359,"You will arrive in a vast and rich territory, but the road to the prosperity is filled with challenges."
1359,"In Brazil: Imperial, you need to construct buildings, manage resources, explore the land, create trade, acquire the support of the greatest personalities of the country, and recruit a powerful army to protect your interest against the rival states."
1359,"If you make the right choices, you can complete missions to progress to a more advanced era, receiving new interesting options of development and victory points."
1359,"In the end, the best monarch receives the title of Brazilian Emperor and constructs a new era of prosperity, freedom and peace!"
1359,"In more detail, while playing in a modular map board that recreate real regions, you use a combination of worker placement, area majority, and individual powers to construct an empire in Brazil between the 16th and 19th centuries."
1359,"You start by choosing one of the available monarchs and its personal game board and components; some monarchs are strong in combat, while others prioritize science or exploration."
1359,"You receive tasks that advance you to a new era when you complete them, giving you access to more power constructions as you move into the second and third eras of the game, then you choose a starting point on the shared map."
1359,"On each turn, you can participate in an action phase and a movement phase."
1359,"You manage actions on your individual game board, and you have these seven choices:

Deploy: Summon one military unit to explore and defend your territory."
1359,Frame: Buy cards that represent famous historic figures to receive special powers and victory points.
1359,"Build: Construct farms, mines, cities, and other structures to generate resources and do other things."
1359,Renovate: Overhaul an old building to produce new resources.
1359,"Manufacture: Produce basic resources — wood, sugar cane, cotton, or coffee — to receive victory points, improve your ""action arches"", and have raw material for more valuable products."
1359,Harbor: Go to the port to receive a small amount of basic resources.
1359,Trade: Sell your basic resources to receive gold and special cards to improve your empire.
1359,"During the movement phase, you can explore hidden places or attack other players."
1359,"For combat, you check the power of the troops involved in the conflict to determine the winner, with cards being able to modify these values."
1359,"Once a player completes their goals in the third era, the game ends and players tally their scores."
1359,"Brazil: Imperial was developed with the concept of it being ""Euro X"", a new style of game that combines Eurogames (in which you collect and manage resources) and 4x games (in which you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate)."
1359,A new concept of maps was also introduced in this game.
1359,All maps are different and created with modular boards that recreate real regions of Brazil and the world.
1359,"Each game you can focus on resource management, combat, or a combination of both, depending on your choice of monarch and the interaction with other players."
1360,Players attempt to build the most successful factory to produce the best products by connecting input and output reservoirs smartly to your machines to build the most profitable factory!
1360,Players each start with a unique empty factory floor with a support pillar in the middle.
1360,During the game you purchase machines to place in your factory.
1360,"Each machine takes 1 to 3 inputs from reservoirs (yellow, blue, red, and brown) and produces one output (of the same colors, or black end products)."
1360,You must always connect all reservoirs and machines correctly by using the connectors (the pipelines).
1360,"At the start this is easy, but becomes more puzzling during the game."
1360,"Players start with one of each color reservoir, and can sometimes acquire additional reservoirs."
1360,On the machine-tiles you see the revenue of each machine.
1360,Connecting machines to each other (input on output) makes more advanced products which brings extra profit.
1360,But building connectors and reservoirs costs money and you must try to have the most money at the end.
1360,"It was originally published by Cwali for 2-4 players, and later reprinted by Z-Man in a larger box with components for 2-5 players."
1360,"Cwali edition (2006)

1361,"In Scotland Yard, one of the players takes on the role of Mr. X."
1361,"His job is to move from point to point around the map of London taking taxis, buses or subways."
1361,"The detectives – that is, the remaining players acting in concert – move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X."
1361,"But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game."
1361,"The 125 fare tickets are 5 black, 23 pink underground, 43 green bus,  54 yellow taxi."

1362,But you are not alone in your mission as the animal guardians have come together to lend a hand around the Circle of Spirits where you progress.
1362,"Each turn, they bring you valuable elements, so try to combine your team of animal guardians as best as possible to carry out your actions, but be careful, some of them are lonely and do not like to be mixed with others...
You have one of three ways to acheive your goal: by planting 12 different Protective Trees, by collecting 12 Sacred Flowers to awaken Sanki the great Guardian of the Forest, by extinguishing 12 Fires to permanently repel Onibi."
1362,"Each turn includes 3 phases: 
• Guardian Animals (simultaneous push your luck phase) : You draw and turn face up, one after the other, the Guardian Animal cards from your personal stack."
1362,You thus form the Animal Guardian Help Line.
1362,You can stop drawing cards whenever you want.
1362,"However, if you reveal a card showing a third solitary symbol, then you must stop drawing cards."
1362,This card closes your Help Line.
1362,• Action phase: You play in turn.
1362,"If your Help Line shows strictly less than three solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious symbols), you can then perform 2 different Actions."
1362,"If your Help Line shows three solitary symbols (not canceled by gregarious symbols), you can then perform only 1 Action."
1362,The strength of an Action is determined by the number of corresponding Elements visible on the Guardian Animal cards in your Help Line and on your Forest individual board.
1362,"• End of the turn:
- Onibi is attacking you: If some Fires remain at the center of the Circle of Spirits and that you cannot resist them, then add as many Fire Varan cards to your discard stack as there are Fire tiles at the center of the Circle of Spirits."
1362,- Onibi is attacking the Sacred Tree: Add as many Fires to the center of the Circle of Spirits as there are Guardian Animal cards taken this turn.
1362,- The arrival of new Guardian Animals: Complete the Guardian Animal reserve by revealing as many new cards per level as there were cards taken this turn.
1362,- Giving the Sacred Tree: Give the Sacred Tree to the next Spirit of Nature clockwise.
1362,- The Return of Guardian Animals: Move all the Animal Guardian cards from your Help Line to your personal discard stack.
1362,The game stops at the end of a complete turn when one of the Spirit of Nature has managed to collect at choice and at least 12 different Protective Trees OR 12 Fires OR 12 Sacred Flowers.
1363,"In the Dungeons & Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game, you play as a heroic adventurer."

1363,"The contents can also be combined with other D&D Adventure System Cooperative play board games, including The Legend of Drizzt and Castle Ravenloft."
1363,"Each player selects a hero, such as a fighter, cleric, or wizard."
1363,"On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters."
1363,"When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added."
1363,"Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play."
1363,"Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest."

DOOM: The Board Game is strategy board game of tactical combat for 2-5 players based on Bethesda and id Software's video game of the same name."
1364,"Featuring two distinct player roles, the game brings the epic battle between elite marines and Hell's most threatening monsters to the tabletop."

1364,"Meanwhile, the invader commands their demons to slaughter the soldiers time and time again in an attempt to protect their fiery domain and destroy all of humanity."
1364,"The game features custom dice, double-sided map tiles, and thirty-seven detailed plastic miniatures representing four marines and thirty-three demons."
1364,"It includes two operations, Black Bishop and Exodus, consisting of six missions each."
1365,Fields of Fire is a solitaire game of commanding a rifle company between World War II and Present Day.
1365,The game is different from many tactical games in that it is diceless and card based.
1365,There are two decks used to play.
1365,The Terrain Deck is based on a specific region and is used to build a map for the various missions your company must perform.
1365,"The Action deck serves many purposes in controlling combat, command and control, various activity attempts."
1365,"The units of the company are counters representing headquarters elements, squads, weapons teams, forward observers, individual vehicles or helicopters."
1365,A single game is a mission and several missions from a historical campaign are strung together for the player to manage experience and replacements.
1365,A mission can be played in about 1 – 4 hours.
1365,"This game is based on three actual campaigns experienced by units of the 9th US Infantry (Regiment) in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam."

1367,"It allows for advance of the gangs as more games are played, as they gain more skills, money, and of course weapons to help them become the rulers of the Under Hive."
1367,In short: a futuristic miniature skirmish game with a well made campaign system.
1368,Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game.
1368,It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next.
1368,"Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda."
1368,"There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style."
1368,Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).
1368,"Yomi is the Japanese word for “reading”, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent."
1368,Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters.
1368,"Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release."

1368,Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game.
1368,"Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make."
1368,"There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to “guess” right almost every time, no matter the game."
1368,"The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards)."
1368,"Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card."
1368,"While it first seems ""just random,"" you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do."
1368,Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.

 Yomi (Second Edition)"
1369,The 1920s: Small City was founded just a few years ago and is still a fledgling town at this stage.
1369,"Nonetheless, the Town Center is prosperous, and the managers of the weird CliniC have been duly incarcerated for years by this point."
1369,Now it is time to reach a new step: Building a new map transit.
1369,"In Tramways, you take the role of one of the managers of the local CliniC who were fired last month when it was discovered that you had acquired wealth on the backs of patients and their poor health."
1369,"You are now at the head of a team of engineers, ready to build the best and most effective network possible for Small City."
1369,"Your aim is to find the best places between buildings and citizens so that they can use your networks (and not those of your opponents, who are always ready to buy the most interesting development areas)."
1369,Be assured that a happy citizen who is able to move where and when he wants will thank the best transport companies.
1369,There is nothing that satisfies a chief manager more than seeing citizens happy...
1369,"The game is divided into six rounds, each of which is divided into two halves:

 During the first half of a round, players compete to acquire the best development cards to create their most efficient deck."
1369,An original auction phase also determines turn order — and being the first player increases your stress level.
1369,"During the second half, they play a train game, using their deck to try to build a great network between the different buildings of Small City."
1369,"They try to move passengers without stressing them during the transit, in the end obtaining happiness points, which is the aim of the game."
1369,"The more that players use the symbols on their cards, the more actions they can do, but they also increase their stress level at the same time, which leads to negative victory points..."

1370,"Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side."
1370,Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table.
1370,"After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it."
1370,"If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck."
1370,The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins.
1370,"If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play."

1371,"Players take the role of the Istari, or Wizards - most familiarly Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast, but also Pallando and Alatar - in the  struggle against Sauron in Middle-Earth."
1371,"Each player competes to bring the greatest strength to bear against the Shadow, including Factions such as the Riders of Rohan or the Great Eagles, allies like Gwaihir or Shadowfax, items such as the lost Palantiri, Glamdring, or Narsil, and the completion of various quests - from the relatively straightforward rescue of prisoners through the involved Reforging of the Sword that was Broken, restoration of the White Tree to Minas Tirith, or the quest of quests, the destruction of the One Ring."
1371,"Players build decks in which half are composed of resource cards and half of hazards, dedicated to the stopping of your opponent."
1371,"This is where the big bad guys come in, with cards for the 9 Nazgul, a couple of Dragons (Smaug being the recognizable one), Shelob, and the Balrog."
1372,"In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game."
1372,"The remainder of this gem deck – with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors – is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up."
1372,"Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing."
1372,"A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice."
1372,"Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown."
1372,"If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret."
1372,Players track information on a score pad.
1372,"You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card."
1372,"If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win."
1372,The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game.
1372,"In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce."
1372,"Any notation system you devise must be both flexible and reliable, recording negative information as well as positive in order to tick off the possibilities one by one...

1374,Moonrakers is a deck-building game in which players choose Contracts to attempt alone or with Allies in order to gain Prestige and Credits.
1374,"After negotiating terms with Allies, players use their decks of Action cards to play Thrusters, Shields, Weapons, Reactors, and Crew to fulfill the requirements on each Contract."
1374,"Each type of Action card has additional effects such as extra Actions, drawing additional cards, and protecting players from Hazards encountered while attempting Contracts."
1374,Players create powerful decks and gain special abilities by upgrading their ships and hiring Crew Members.
1374,"This helps them accomplish more difficult and rewarding contracts alone, letting them keep more Prestige and Credits for themselves."
1374,"Allies negotiate who will receive the Prestige, Credits, and risk of Hazard from Contracts, but if you don't make your offers enticing enough players may be tempted to betray you!"
1374,"The first player to 10 Prestige wins, but be careful as hazards encountered on Contracts reduce your Prestige!"

1375,"(Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)"
1375,"The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters."
1375,The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out.
1375,"The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook."
1375,The game is a set collection game at its core.
1375,Players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.
1375,"During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates."
1375,Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.
1375,"On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card."
1375,Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market.
1375,"There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market."
1375,"Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5)."
1375,"When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay."
1375,"If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action."
1375,"Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player."
1375,These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color.
1375,"Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased)."
1375,"If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later)."
1375,"If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market."
1375,2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market.
1375,Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.
1375,Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand.
1375,"That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners."
1375,This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.
1375,Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm.
1375,This card is now unavailable to all other players.
1375,The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good.
1375,"The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do."
1375,"After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends."
1375,"If a payout occurs, each player that has goods on that ship takes part."
1375,First the players count how many of that colored good they have.
1375,Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value.
1375,"They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10."
1375,"For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10."
1375,The player then takes that value and divides by 5.
1375,The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps.
1375,"Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2."
1375,This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set.
1375,Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit.
1375,"These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile."
1375,At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point.
1375,This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage.
1375,"Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage."
1375,Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).
1375,"When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods, will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set."
1375,They then figure out how many cards they keep.
1375,"For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5."
1375,The player also has two blue tokens.
1375,The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7.
1375,"Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25."
1375,"After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards."
1375,"If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference."
1375,These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.
1375,"After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked."
1375,Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships.
1375,"Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them."
1375,"When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates."
1375,"For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected."
1375,"After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage."
1375,The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens.
1375,The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile).
1375,"If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have."
1375,"If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie."
1376,Blokus Trigon is an abstract strategy game from the makers of Blokus.
1376,The board pieces have changed from square to triangular.
1376,"Game play is similar to Blokus, as players try to get rid of all their pieces."
1376,There is a solitaire version where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.
1376,"Components:

Hexagonal playing board with 486 triangles on the board
4 sets of 22 pieces in red, blue, green and yellow

 1 piece made up of one triangle."
1376,1 piece made up of two triangles.
1376,1 piece made up of three triangles.
1376,3 pieces made up of four triangles.
1376,4 pieces made up of five triangles.
1376,12 pieces made up of six triangles.
1376,"Set up:
Layout your hexagonal silver board and give each player a set of 22 pieces."
1376,"Game Play:
Each player begins at one of the marked spaces on the board."
1376,"The order of play is blue, yellow, red, green colours."
1376,"As the play progresses, each new piece is placed on the board."
1376,"The new piece placed must touch another piece of the same colour, and it can only touch corner-to-corner or corner-to-edge."
1376,The constraint is that a piece can never touch another piece of the same colour edge-to-edge.
1376,"When a player cannot place any more pieces on the board (either because they are blocked and can't fit any more, or because they have already placed all of their pieces), they must drop out of the game."
1376,The other players continue until no one is able to place any more pieces on the board.
1376,"Scoring:

At the end of the game, each player must count the number of triangles that they were unable to place on the trigon board, and calculates their score as follows:

 Each triangle that is not placed on the board counts as a negative point."
1376,"15 points are awarded as a bonus, if the player has all 22 pieces placed on the board."
1376,This bonus increases to 20 points if the 22 pieces were placed on the board with the single triangle piece being placed last.
1376,Players can choose to play multiple rounds and keep a running tally of the scores.
1376,The winner is the person with the maximum points!
1377,Cross Clues is a cooperative party game about making connections between clues.

1378,Expedition to Newdale is the new Oh my Goods!
1378,game from renowned designer Alexander Pfister.
1378,"In this board game adaption of the successful card game, 1 to 4 players from 12 and up compete in different chapters to experience the world of the Longsdale kingdom once again."
1378,The story of Expedition to Newdale starts about five years after the events from Oh my Goods!
1378,"Escape to Canyon Brook, but you don’t need to know the prequels at all."
1378,Each chapter of the game lasts about 90 minutes which adds up to around 12 hours of exciting campaign gameplay.
1378,"And when you found your favorite chapter while playing the campaign, you can always come back and play it again to have even more fun!"
1378,"At the beginning of the game you have your personal board, a coal mine as your start building and 5 hand cards."
1378,"Depending on which chapter you are playing, the appropriate game board sits in the middle of the table."
1378,"Each round is divided into 5 phases which are played in order (or partially parallel, once you become more familiar with the game)."
1378,"In phase 1, a new event is revealed which usually alters the course of play in this round slightly (e. g., by introducing new buildings)."
1378,Additionally the event card shows a fixed amount of workers which are available this round.
1378,"An information which is much appreciated, as you have to place your action markers in phase 2."
1378,The latter are numbered 1 — 4 which is important for phase 4 and means that you need to plan ahead.
1378,"But first phase 3: in this phase, more workers are drawn from a bag and get added to the others."
1378,This means that productions which would have been impossible before (because workers were missing) are now easily done.
1378,Pushing your luck might be beneficial!
1378,Phase 4 is the opposite to phase 2.
1378,"Instead of placing your workers, you resolve their chosen action in order of their numbers."
1378,"We hope you had a backup plan in place if your desired workers were not drawn in phase 3, because this can trigger an unpleasant chain of events!"
1378,"Not enough workers could mean that a production does not happen, which then means that you might not have enough money to build the building with your second action marker."
1378,"Oh, and your third marker was planned to directly produce in the newly built building?"
1378,"Well, where there is no building, there’s no place to produce in, right?"
1378,"Clearly: planning ahead, a little luck and good alternatives are the way to success."
1378,"In Phase 5, all players can either use a free building action or draw new hand cards."
1378,"The last phase is used to resolve all buildings which do not need workers, e. g., an automatic coal production or a building which offers the conversion of a certain good to victory points."
1378,"Afterwards the next round starts, of which you play a total of seven."
1378,A final scoring at the end of round seven will then show if you win or lose.
1379,Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800's England.
1379,There are seven different rail companies that players can expand.
1379,"Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares."
1379,"When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one."
1379,"The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game."
1380,"In Coup: Rebellion G54 (G54), the last player with influence in the game wins, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area."
1380,Before each game players choose five character roles from a randomized deck.
1380,"Characters have a unique variable power, and the deck is formed by three iterations of each role for fifteen cards total."
1380,"A player starts the game with two coins and two influence cards – i.e., two face-down character cards."
1380,"On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:

Income: Take one coin from the treasury."
1380,"Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence."
1380,"(If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)"
1380,"When you take one of the character actions – whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action – that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you."
1380,"In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up."
1380,"Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game."
1380,"If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not."
1380,"The last player to still have influence – that is, a face-down character – wins the game!"
1380,"Coup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game."
1380,"This is more of a gamer's game than the original Coup as you can create a deck to increase bluffing, deduction, negotiation or luck."
1381,Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years.
1381,"Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board."
1381,"Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll."
1381,"Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board."
1381,The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board.
1381,"A more recent addition to the game is the ""doubling cube"", which allows players to up the stakes of the game."
1381,"Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get."
1381,"Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia."
1381,"During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur."
1381,"At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board."
1381,"Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters."
1381,The names of the game were many.
1381,"In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means ""Battle on Wood""."
1381,"In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat."
1381,"In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (""game of twelve marks""), later, Tabula (""table""), and by the sixth century, Alea (""dice"")."
1381,"In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko."
1381,"The English name may derive from ""Bac gamen"" meaning ""Back Game"", referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board."
1381,"It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called ""The Aristocratic Game."""
1381,The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).
1381,The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle.
1381,These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.
1382,"In 506, Sun Tzu marched up the Hwai River where he was assaulted by Ch'u armies under the command of King Shao."
1382,Sun Tzu and his Wu soldiers were outnumbered and King Shao's armies held the high ground.
1382,"Sun Tzu feigned retreat and tricked King Shao into spreading out his forces, ready to pursue."
1382,"With the Ch'u scattered, Sun Tzu crushed their forces in piecemeal fashion at the battle of Bai Ju, routing the Ch'u back to their capital of Ying."
1382,King Shao fled Ying seeking refuge and asylum across the borders while Sun Tzu remained the master of strategy and tactics.
1382,"In Sun Tzu, a.k.a."
1382,"Dynasties, players take on the role of Sun Tzu or King Shao, leading these two opposing armies in an attempt to unify China through the deployment of their armies and forces rather than by brute force."
1382,"Each turn players play cards to specific provinces, then reveal them individually by province."
1382,Armies are added or removed from the province depending on who played the higher valued card or who played a special card.
1382,"Some cards can only be used once, so playing the card at the correct time is critical to a winning strategy."
1382,"The game has a feel of ""tug-of-war"" as the scoring marker starts in the middle of the scoring scale and the players attempt to move the marker to their side of the track."
1382,The game ends after nine rounds or if either player is able to move the scoring marker to the last space on his side of the scoring track.
1383,"""The Sword of Rome"" is the latest in GMT’s acclaimed line of card-driven board wargames."
1383,It uses the popular base system invented by Mark Herman and featured in Ted Raicer’s Paths of Glory.
1383,"This time, event cards and point-to-point maneuver enable up to four players to recreate the vicious struggles among the peoples of Italy and Sicily in 4th and 3rd Centuries BC."
1383,Who will dominate the western Mediterranean–and with it earn the right to vie for control of the known world?
1383,"The Sword of Rome includes rules and events for city loyalty, Roman colonies, tribal raids, Gallic indiscipline, Greek siege craft, Indian war elephants, Roman and Macedonian-style infantry tactics, the mountain fastness of Samnium, and much, much more."
1383,The game covers over 100 years of classical history in just 9 hands of cards.
1383,"The interplay of each power’s special strengths, of the strategy decks’ 152 event cards, and of up to four players’ diplomatic acumen provides unlimited variety."
1383,"But the rules remain at low-moderate complexity, and the familiar, underlying system is easily mastered."

1384,"Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick game that implements the Civilization/Exploration theme using card-driven area control (by placing armies and cities in a small map) and set collection (by getting resources from the board and the cards)."
1384,Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents.
1384,"All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices."
1384,"Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected."
1384,"Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013."
1384,"An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends)."
1384,"From the publisher:
Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!"
1384,"In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed."
1384,"The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately."
1384,"Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects."
1384,Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.
1384,It's easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes.

1385,And knowing that the Credits that you need to get at the end of the game in order to win are based on how your Crew is composed only emphasizes that.

1391,"Deep beneath the crust, the oceans are teeming with alien sea life."
1391,"Shellfish, plants, corals, arthropods, even strange fish and larger sea creatures populate a wide-ranging interconnected web of hidden seas."
1391,"Volcanism is rampant, warming the mineral-rich waters and creating excellent conditions for energy-harvesting."
1391,The largest cavern close to the surface is known as The Pocket.
1391,"This is where the initial teams of Stabilizers built their first outposts, with the intent to establish long-term communities capable of surviving indefinitely."
1391,Aqua-farming is well established; food and other sundries are efficiently gathered.
1391,The Pocket has many deposits of minerals and crystals that can be mined and processed to create strong and versatile construction materials locally.
1391,Colonists arrive at the Doorstep at regular intervals when the Threshold is opened.
1391,"The arrivals are of four general types: Pioneers (who are tasked with exploring the changing surface of the moon and the labyrinth of seas beneath), Engineers (who develop and operate the machinery and structures needed to run the colonies), Marines (who defend the colonies from hostile sea life, unwanted intruders, and other colonies), and Stewards (overseers responsible for strategy and negotiation)."
1391,"Colony development mostly occurs beneath the ice; this is where all of the moon’s resources are concentrated, so this is where the effort is best spent."
1391,"To keep close to the surface, most colony structures are built clinging onto the underside of the ice crust."
1391,Surface structures will be built only once an undersea outpost is well established and beginning to thrive.
1391,"In addition to construction and resource-gathering, colonies spend a lot of effort on exploring this new environment."
1391,"The volcanic action and mineral-heavy waters make long-range scanning unreliable, so physical exploration is required to plumb the depths."
1391,"As the Pocket is explored and expanded, the established colonies have been making some unusual discoveries beneath the ice."
1391,"Deep in the trenches, artifacts of non-human origin are starting to be found."
1391,The dark seas hide many secrets.

1393,My Village is of similar game weight as Village.
1394,SHOBU is a beautifully crafted abstract strategy game for 2 players.
1394,"The game features 4 square wood boards (2 of each color) and 16 natural river stones for each player, in two colors, with a rope dividing the play area in half."
1394,Your turn is in two parts.
1394,"First, a player may move one of their stones up to two spaces in any direction, including diagonally, in what is called a passive (or set up) move."
1394,"Second, they take a more aggressive move, which must be the same direction and number of spaces as the first move."
1394,It is this second move that allows you to push stones across the board - or off the board's edge.
1394,Remove all four of your opponent's stones from just one of the four boards to win.
1394,SHOBU evokes the feeling of GO or CHESS but provides its own unique challenge.
1394,It feels immediately familiar and yet is wholly distinct and engaging.

1395,"In the near future, nanofacturing techniques will allow incredible new materials to be built atom by atom."
1395,But they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space.
1395,Various private and government enterprises race to establish a buckytube mechanosynthesis factory on a suitable carbonaceous asteroid.
1395,"To do so, they accumulate tanks of water in orbiting fuel depots, to be used as rocket propellant."
1395,Also needed are remote-controlled robonauts to do the grunt work.
1395,The key to success is water in LEO (low Earth orbit).
1395,"At first, water will be expensively supported out of the deep gravity well of Earth."
1395,"But for a third the fuel and energy, water can be supplied from Luna, the moons of Mars, or other nearby hydrated objects."
1395,Extracting resources at the work site is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU).
1395,Whoever develops ISRU technology able to glean water from space rather than Earth will gain the strategic high ground to make money through exoglobalization.
1395,"In High Frontier, players are Earth governments which are racing to put together a functioning space program to extract resources and colonize the other planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system."
1395,"Players use water in LEO as currency to bid on space-related patents for thrusters, refineries, and robotics."
1395,"Putting together a functional craft is not easy, as the heavier the craft becomes, the less maneuverable it is and the more fuel (also water in LEO) the craft will require, so players have to balance useful heavy parts with lighter, less functional parts."
1395,"Victory points are awarded for successful mineral extractions, and for being the first to reach key technologies and exploration points in the solar system."

1396,"The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card."
1396,"If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers."
1396,Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once.
1396,The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it.
1396,Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers.

1396,Rosenkönig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.
1397,Las Vegas Royale combines the original Las Vegas dice game from 2012 with some elements of the Las Vegas Boulevard expansion from 2014.
1397,"Las Vegas is an easy-to-learn, dice-rolling game that includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die."
1397,"For each mat in the basic game, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable."
1397,"Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling."
1397,"When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked ""1""."
1397,You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn.
1397,All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used.
1397,"Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the highest-valued money associated with it, then the player with the secondmost dice takes the next highest-valued money card."
1397,"In case of a tie, the non-tied player with the most dice takes the highest-valued money card at that casino, while the tied players get bupkis."
1397,"Las Vegas Royale includes twelve expansion tiles, and to play a more involved game, you can place an expansion tile at random by each casino."
1397,"These tiles have special abilities on them, and by placing dice on them, players can activate these abilities."
1397,The expansion components also include a larger than normal die for each player that counts as two dice.

1399,"At the dawn of the SMC age, the people were losing faith in an increasingly amoral society."
1399,"Mother was developed to emulate human thought and emotion, to simulate human desires and aspirations, to better understand the rapid decline in morality."
1399,The citizens of Sapporo became the guinea-pigs for this technological experiment.
1399,"A series of city-wide neural implant programs, dubbed “the harvests”, enabled the gathering of data directly from a person’s cerebral cortex."
1399,Mother’s neural net became more and more empowered by the collective thoughts of a city of souls.
1399,"She soon became her own master, not just reading the minds of her citizens, but controlling them."
1399,Mother was in charge and the people were now her automatons.
1399,"Only a few, the few who from fear, mistrust or in protest, avoided the harvests and remained untouched by Mother’s influence."
1399,Like sewer rats they hide in an underground complex in Sapporo's Susukino district.
1399,"While society at large became free from crime, free from poverty, free from emotion, without free-will or faith, from these few there came the criminals, the bootleggers, and the self-serving; the hungry, the frightened and the “Renegades”."
1399,Renegade is an abstract-euro thematic deck-building game for 1 to 5 players.
1399,You are a new breed of Decker - a Renegade.

1399,You must survive a series of Countermeasure events before the network becomes overrun by Sparks and Guardians.
1399,"Once you are jacked into an SMC’s servers, with a profile bringing its own special ability, you will move across its partitions and fight to take control of the network by using informational, destructive, deceptive and cognitive attacks."
1399,"Your Decker can seek upgrades (tools, software, apparel and information) by visiting the local bar, the ""Hack Shack""."
1399,"Once a fashionable hang-out for attractive young lovers seeking a voyeur's view of the city, it has now gone underground."
1399,"An intimidating bar full of hit men and debt collectors, fixers and dealers, trading contraband from all across Sapporo, it's not the sort of place to take a date."
1399,"This is where you will trade for new command cards, enhancing your Command Deck to become a more skillful Renegade."
1400,"""The Outlaws hunt the Sheriff."
1400,The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws.
1400,"The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other."
1400,Bullets fly.
1400,"Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff?"
1400,"And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him?"
1400,"If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!"""
1400,"(From back of box)
The card game BANG!"
1400,"recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal."
1400,"Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:

 Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade
 Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws
 Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff
 Renegade - Be the last person standing

A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff."
1400,"Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability."
1400,There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck.
1400,Most common are the BANG!
1400,"cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within ""range"" of your current gun."
1400,"The target player can play a ""MISSED!"""
1400,card to dodge the shot.
1400,"Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout)."
1400,"A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5."
1400,"The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!"
1400,"Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included."

1402,Will players be able to find their friend in time and escape this cavernous world full of dark mysteries?
1402,"Like other titles in the series, Exit: The Game – The Catacombs of Horror includes components meant to be folded, written upon, or torn, so it's marketed as a single-use game."
1402,"What's different in this game is that it consists of two parts, with each part being its own challenge."
1403,"In Kashgar: Händler der Seidenstraße, the players trade different spices that are coming over the silk road from Asia to Europe."
1403,Each player has control over three caravans.
1403,"In the beginning, each caravan consists of three cards that are spread out vertically so that the top part of each card is visible; each card stands for a caravan member with different abilities."
1403,"On their turn, a player performs only one action, choosing one of the cards on top of the three families and executing one action shown on that card."
1403,Then the card is put at the back of its caravan.
1403,"To use the same caravan member again, a player must first use all the other cards on top of that caravan row."
1403,"These actions can influence the player's stock of spice, gold and mules."
1403,"To keep track of that stock, each player has their own board with wooden markers that are moved accordingly."
1403,Actions can also bring new members to the caravans and can enable the player to fulfill one of four delivery request cards from the middle of the table.
1403,"Finally, there are actions that mix things up a bit, such as by getting rid of a caravan member or even influencing other players' caravans."
1403,The game ends when one player has earned 25 points by collecting character cards and fulfilling delivery request cards.
1403,"The core mechanism of Kashgar could be called ""open deck-building""."
1403,The game plays quickly with little downtime.
1403,"After having learned the different actions of the cards, players can start trying out different strategies and combinations of caravan members, caravan sizes, etc."

1404,"The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met."
1404,"The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played."

1412,The Scepter of Zavandor is about magic and power.
1412,"Players represent young magicians who have gained possession of old magic knowledge, and with it they attempt to achieve the powerful position of archmage, symbolized by the Scepter of Zavandor."
1412,"To increase their power and influence, the young magicians enchant jewels and seek out knowledge."
1412,An auction mechanism also allows them to acquire artifacts and sentinels.
1412,"Victory points are earned through active gems, artifacts, sentinels, and knowledge."
1412,The game's rulebook includes a note thanking James Hlavaty for permission to copy the game mechanics from Outpost.
1413,Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas.
1413,"Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts."
1413,The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).
1413,A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.
1413,"Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes."
1413,These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President.
1413,The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations.
1413,Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion.
1413,The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.
1413,Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations.
1413,"Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round."
1413,"If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup."
1413,A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers.
1413,Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g.
1413,"army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over."
1413,"At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President."
1413,And someone is sent to the firing squad.
1413,"Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account."
1413,The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.
1414,"In Havana you acquire victory points by constructing buildings, available as tiles displayed on the table."
1414,"To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials."
1414,More difficult combinations yield more victory points.
1414,"Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection."
1414,"The game's core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round."
1414,"But in addition to the card's function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g."
1414,"a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first."
1414,"So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role."
1414,"Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your ""half of all pesos in the middle"" is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card)."
1414,"Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it's not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner."
1414,"Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him."
1414,Other cards add different twists.
1414,"What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you're aiming for, make up the game's main decisions."
1414,These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar.
1414,"It's shorter and lighter than many similar games, as well."
1415,"In World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, players journey to the frozen continent of Northrend to face the armies of the Lich King."
1415,"This ""Pandemic System"" game showcases familiar mechanisms and gameplay, now tweaked to embrace the setting of the Wrath of the Lich King."
1415,"Forts, temples, battlegrounds, and more populate the game board as you and your fellow heroes journey across the cold landscape."
1415,"Along the way, you'll set up strongholds, complete quests, and do battle with legions of undead."
1415,"In more detail, players team up as legendary heroes from across Azeroth, each with their own unique abilities to help in and out of combat."
1415,"Heroes such as Thrall, Warchief of the Horde; Varian Wrynn, King of Stormwind; Sylvanas Windrunner, Banshee Queen of the Forsaken; and many more are at your fingertips."
1415,"As the Scourge grows, more undead will populate the board."
1415,"Throw dice as you enter into battle against the hordes of ghouls and ferocious abominations, using hero cards to add power to your attacks, block incoming assaults, heal wounds, take mounts to far off spaces, and so much more."
1415,"As you fight your way to the Lich King, all manner of dark magic and terrible creatures under his control need to be neutralized."
1415,"This comes in the form of quests, a brand-new mechanism that can be completed as a team through a combination of dice rolls and the hero cards at your disposal."
1415,"However, each quest comes with its own dangers and hindrances."
1415,"Complete these quests to move closer to the final assault on Icecrown Citadel, where the Lich King himself resides."

1416,The classic collectible card game Deadlands: Doomtown returns as an Expandable Card Game in Doomtown: Reloaded.
1416,"Featuring four factions fighting for control of Gomorra, California."
1416,Doomtown: Reloaded allows you to build your own deck from a fixed set of cards in the box.
1416,"Play your dudes to control deeds in the town, and use actions, hexes, and more to thwart your opponents."
1416,Shootouts are resolved via a poker mechanism as every card has a suit and value.
1416,Preparing for the hands you want to draw is as much a part of deck building as choosing the actions and dudes you'll want to play.
1416,"Your deck is built around an Outfit, one of the four main groups attempting to control Gomorra, California, and these outfits are:

The Law Dogs: The Sheriff and his deputies, tasked with enforcing law and order in an extremely chaotic town."
1416,"The Sloane Gang: The main cause of a lot of the chaos, the Sloane Gang takes what they want, no matter who it costs."
1416,"The Morgan Cattle Company: Progress and investment, Morgan Cattle has moved into the surrounding ranch lands and uses its deep pockets to influence the town."
1416,"The Fourth Ring: It's that circus that's been here for months, but I swear it just arrived..."
1416,"The base set of Doomtown: Reloaded will be followed by Saddlebag expansions, in-store OP events, and the Badge Series of tournaments."
1417,The spark of life is about to jump from your hands to spread out in the world.
1417,"Deploy your mountain ranges and your deserts, spread out your oceans and your glaciers."
1417,Handle wisely your continents to form environments suitable for the apparition of animal life and maybe you'll manage to create the most densely populated planet!
1417,"In Planet, each player receives a planet core without anything on it."
1417,"Each turn, players choose a tile with mountain/ice/forest/desert on it and place it on the planet."
1417,Then the player who fulfills the most conditions for the appearance of certain animals gains its card.
1417,—description from the publisher
1418,"In this game, players incarnate clan leaders during the Golden Age of Easter Island."
1418,The board represents a simplified map of the island.
1418,Rock platforms (ahus) are where the Moaïs (monumental sculptures) will be erected.
1418,"Your clan competes against others, and you will earn more prestige by building and transporting larger, more imposing Moaïs than your opponents' clans."
1418,Each of your pawns represents a group of men.
1418,You can grow your population if you wish.
1418,"You will choose each turn which part of your population will sculpt Moaïs and which other part will transport them, in cooperation with other players."
1418,Statues are transported from the quarry to the ahus (the rock platforms) using paths made of pawns and the help of logs.
1418,You can use your influence (Tribal Markers) to choose the best statues and mark to your color the statues you cannot achieve in your turn.
1418,"You can also rely on your Sorcerer and his mighty powers, of the strength of your Chief, as well as on mystic powers of the Rongo writing tablets."
1418,The winner will be the one who has erected the largest statues in the best places at the end of the game.
1418,"Note that there is a Official Rule Change for this game : For the final scoring, complete Rongo tablets are no longer scored and do not earn any points to the players."
1419,"You are an air-shipwright, that is, an inventor of flying machines used by the dreams to traverse the skies of the Oniverse."
1419,"You have been challenged to build a new fleet, the most beautiful ever seen."
1419,Now you must roll the dice to acquire the components you need to build airships.
1419,"In Aerion, a solo/co-operative game for 1-2 players, you must find the best blueprints, acquire the finest construction materials, and recruit the best crew."
1419,"Discarding cards can adjust your die rolls, but be careful not to exhaust your resources!"
1419,Can you build the best fleet?
1419,Aerion includes six expansion modules with new options and challenges.
1419,—description from the publisher
1420,Pueblo - the ultimate building challenge!
1420,"Work with the other players to create a mighty home for the Chieftain, stone by stone."
1420,"You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized."
1420,"The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes!"
1420,Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.
1420,The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi.
1420,The board is a fairly small square.
1420,"Each player gets a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 fewer than the colored)."
1420,"Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the ""Chieftain""  around the outer track surrounding the board."
1420,"If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad."
1420,"And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points."
1420,"Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block."
1420,"Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way."
1420,The player who has gained the fewest number of points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.
1420,"There are also some extra components for making the game more challenging by adding an element of bidding for turn order, and from 1 to 4 sacred sites that cannot be built upon."
1420,Original description from box.
1421,"Epic Railroad Building in North America
Discover a modern North American classic."
1421,Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.
1421,Use your initial investment to build track.
1421,"Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand."
1421,"Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire."
1421,Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!
1421,"The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America."
1421,Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.
1421,"For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train."
1421,"The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff."
1421,Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.
1421,Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.
1421,"During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards."
1421,"When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one."
1421,Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.
1421,When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.
1421,During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.
1421,"A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand."
1422,"Spyfall is a party game unlike any other, one in which you get to be a spy and try to understand what's going on around you."
1422,It's really simple!
1422,"Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location — except that one player receives a card that says ""Spy"" instead of the location."
1422,"Players then start asking each other questions — ""Why are you dressed so strangely?"""
1422,"or ""When was the last time we got a payday?"""
1422,or anything else you can come up with — trying to guess who among them is the spy.
1422,"The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully."
1422,"When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!"
1422,"At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy."
1422,"If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity."
1422,"If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points."
1422,"However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points."
1422,"After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!"
1422,"Spyfall 2 features the same gameplay as Spyfall with two important changes: (1) Enough location cards are included that the upper player count is now twelve instead of eight, and (2) two spies can be found at each location, giving all of the non-spy players more of a challenge when it comes to tracking down who doesn't belong."
1423,Three Sisters is a strategic roll-and-write game about backyard farming.
1423,"Three Sisters is named after an indigenous agricultural technique still widely used today in which three different crops — in this case, pumpkins, corn, and beans — are planted close together."
1423,"Corn provides a lattice for beans to climb, the beans bring nitrogen from the air into the soil, and the squash provides a natural mulch ground cover to reduce weeds and keep pests away."
1423,"In the game, you have your own player sheet with multiple areas: the garden, which is divided into six numbered zones, each containing the three crop types; the apiary; compost; perennials; goods; fruit; and the shed, which is filled with tools that have special abilities."
1423,"All the crops, fruits, flowers, and hives are represented by tracks that you will mark off as you acquire these items."
1423,"Many of the tracks are interconnected with other elements in the game, giving you bonuses along the way."
1423,"A common feature of these tracks are circles that represent a harvest, which generates goods; get enough goods, and you unlock bonus actions."
1423,"Advancing on all of these tracks offers various amounts of points, advancements, and bonuses."
1423,The game lasts eight rounds.
1423,"Each round, roll dice based on the number of players, group them by number, then place them on an action space of the circular action wheel, starting with the current position of the farmer; the farmer moves each round, which means that dice showing 1s, 2s, etc."
1423,will end up on different spaces each round.
1423,"Once the dice have been placed, each player drafts one die and uses it as described below."
1423,"Once everyone has drafted a die, all players get to use the lowest-valued die remaining on the action wheel."
1423,"A die lets you do two things, which you can do in either order:

 Plant or water the numbered zone matching the value of the die."
1423,Take the action of the space from which you removed the die.
1423,"To plant, you mark the bottom space of two empty crop tracks."
1423,(Note that you can't plant beans until the corn adjacent to the beans is tall enough to support them.)
1423,"To water, you mark one space in all the crop tracks that already have at least one mark in them."
1423,"As for the actions on the action wheel, you can:

 Plant or water again in the same numbered zone."
1423,Gain one compost (which lets you adjust die values) and four goods (which will get you bonuses at the farmer's market).
1423,"Mark off the hive track, which can bring you points, goods, or bonus actions."
1423,Mark one of the four fruit tracks.
1423,Each fruit is worth different points and different amounts of goods and has different track lengths and circle positions.
1423,"Visit the farmer's market, which gives you points and bonuses based on the number of goods you've collected."
1423,Mark one of the fifteen tool tracks in your shed.
1423,"As soon as you complete a track, you gain that power or end-game scoring opportunity."
1423,"Perennials don't have a direct action associated with them and are marked off only through actions in other areas, with the various perennials giving different bonuses as you mark them."
1423,"At the end of the round, all players receive a bonus action, either rain that waters all numbered zones in your garden, a trip to the shed, or a visit to the farmer's market."
1423,"After eight rounds, you score points for harvested crops, perennials, the apiary, fruit, and some shed items."
1423,Whoever has the most points wins.
1423,"Three Sisters has a solo mode in which you try to top your own score against an ""opponent"" that drafts dice and blocks areas of your sheet."
1424,"Codex: Card-Time Strategy is a customizable, non-collectible card game set in the Fantasy Strike universe that's inspired by real-time strategy video games such as Starcraft and Warcraft 3."
1424,Players each control three different heroes and have access to a tech tree that allows them to use different strategies each time they play.
1424,The goal of the game is to destroy the opponent's base.
1424,"To do this, players build up an army of units and heroes."
1424,Players determine the exact composition of their armies as they play by adding cards to their deck based on the tech they've chosen to pursue.
1425,Ascension: Immortal Heroes is both a supplement to Gary Games' full-sized expansion/stand-alone game Ascension: Storm of Souls as well as a stand-alone two-player game in its own right.
1425,"As the second set in the series, Ascension: Immortal Heroes completes the Storm of Souls story arc, with players trying to wield the power of past heroes with new Soul Gem cards – representing the trapped souls of heroes from the past – to stop the rebel godling Kythis from fueling his mad ascent to godhood."
1425,"As with other Ascension titles, Immortal Heroes is a deck-building game in which players acquire cards from a central pool to add to their decks for use later; at the same time, they also combat creatures and other things that show up in that shared space."
1425,Both cards acquired and creatures defeated earn a player points.
1426,"While the headline game, Mü, is the main attraction, this deck of custom cards comes with rules for several games:

Mü - A complex trick-taking game."
1426,"For 3-6 players, ages 12 and up."
1426,"The Last Panther - A trick-taking game similar to Hearts, where players try to avoid negative points."
1426,"For 3-8 players, ages 10 and up."
1426,"Wimmüln - A trick-taking game where players must estimate how many tricks they will take, akin to Oh Hell!."
1426,"For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up."
1426,Rummü - A Rummy-like card laying game where players try to get rid of their hands by playing high-scoring combinations of cards.
1426,"For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up."
1426,"Safarü - A card ""catching"" game using basic adding skills."
1426,"For 2-4 players, ages 10 and up."
1426,"Calcory (only in the original 1995-1998 edition) - A memory and calculation game, where players push their luck to uncover the most cards."
1426,"For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up."
1426,"Calcory uses wooden markers that were not packaged in subsequent releases, so the game was dropped from the set."
1426,Mü is regarded by many as one of the best offerings in the trick-taking genre.
1426,Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.
1426,"Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points."
1426,"The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal."
1426,The deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.
1426,"Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards."
1426,"Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card."
1426,Mü and Lots More includes a a tweaked version of Mü and a different set of games.
1427,"It's 43,000 BC in Ice Age Europe, the dawn of modern man."
1427,"In Neanderthal, you are one of three human species: Archaic, Neanderthal, or Cro-Magnon."
1427,"Assign your males to hunt Pleistocene megafauna, but try to avoid being eaten by predators."
1427,"Assign your women for teaching your children vocabulary, leading to cognitive fluidity in the next generation and to a tribalistic culture."
1427,"Specialize your elders for fire, war, big game, inventions, or animal domestications."
1427,"Choose between three mating strategies: promiscuous, harems, or pair bonding."
1427,"Victory depends on which strategy you choose, and may include your hunters, elders, women, vocabulary, trophies, inventions, or domesticated animals."
1427,"At this point, the players have developed to the point where the companion game Greenland begins, so you can flow one game into another seamlessly."
1428,"User review:
The six Investor cards are shuffled and one is dealt face up to each player."
1428,Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now.
1428,The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down.
1428,The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first.
1428,The player to the starting player’s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board.
1428,Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors.
1428,"On one’s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the six-sided die."
1428,"If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces."
1428,"Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards."
1428,"If by drawing cards, the player’s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit."
1428,"Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake."
1428,The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile.
1428,"Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal:
•    Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not."
1428,•    Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations.
1428,Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor.
1428,•    Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player’s Investor and make it your own.
1428,•    Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations.
1428,"•    Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards."
1428,The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck.
1428,"The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player."
1428,"Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time)."
1428,Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!
1429,"Similo  is a co-operative deduction game, and each version of the game — e.g., Fables, History, Myths — comes with a deck of thirty cards, beautifully illustrated by Naïade, showing the portrait and the name of a series of characters with a common theme."
1429,"Your goal is to make the other players guess one secret character (out of the twelve characters on display in the middle of the table) by playing other character cards from your hand as clues, stating whether they are similar to or different from the secret character."
1429,"After each turn, the other players must remove one or more characters from the table until only the right one remains and you win — or it is removed and you lose!"
1429,"You can play with one of the Similo sets on its own, using the cards from, say, Fables both for the characters being laid out and for the clues being given to the guessers, or you can use the cards from one set for the twelve characters on display and the cards from another set as the clues."
1429,The game is far trickier this way!
1430,"Philippe Keyaerts scored gold with Small World, a new version of his Vinci that was released by Days of Wonder in 2009 to great acclaim and numerous awards."
1430,"With Olympos, coming from French publisher Ystari Games, Keyaerts has another go at the simplified civilization game."
1430,"The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 3-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, ""Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game."""
1430,"Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes."
1430,"(Says Demaegd, ""This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago."")"
1430,"By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development."
1430,"Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources."
1430,"Development takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries – such as medicine or phalanxes – or building architectural wonders."
1430,"Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points."
1430,"A player's piety is measured by discoveries, and the most pious player might be rewarded during the game by one of the nine gods included."
1430,"Similarly, the less pious players might be punished by those same gods."
1430,"The replayability of Olympos is huge, says Demaegd, as the discovery board and gods in play will be different each game, not to mention the territories you're able to conquer."
1431,"In the fast-paced and morbidly kitschy game Hit Z Road, you and your fellow players embark on a road trip going south from Chicago along America's famous Route 66 — now infested by zombies."
1431,"As you travel though a deck of adventure cards rife with dangers, you battle zombie hordes, drive abandoned school buses, scavenge for gas and bullets, and explore a darkened, tainted American countryside full of shambling undead, haunted carnivals, and plumes of toxic gas."
1431,"Your goal is to stay alive until you reach the safe, sandy beaches of the California coast."
1431,Three different stages of adventure cards create an experience of increasing difficulty and ensure that each playthrough is unique.
1431,Each round begins with an auction that determines both player order and which cards you will encounter.
1431,"Since the resources used for bidding are the same as those used to battle the oncoming zombie hordes, your survival depends as much on your resource management as it does upon winning those bidding wars."
1431,The player who either accumulates the most points or survives the longest wins.
1431,"Zombies of all types await, with cannibals, anti-personnel mines and radioactive wastes also being among the hazards awaiting the players."
1431,Who will survive the zombie onslaught?

1432,"From clucking chickens to rumbling tractors, the sounds of a bustling farm are everywhere."
1432,It's up to your team of planners to turn this little farm into a flourishing ranching community!
1432,"Having developed dream cities in Sprawlopolis, it's now time to set your sights on the rolling countryside, where farm, ranches, and roads intermingle master plan, as ever, seems just out of reach."
1432,"Agropolis is a stand-alone expansion to Sprawlopolis, bringing the same card-laying, variable-scoring gameplay into a new setting: city blocks give way to orchards, wheat fields, livestock pens, and vineyards."
1432,"As before, players draw three goal cards and then attempt to place cards one at a time to create a rural tableau that best satisfies those goals."
1432,"New gameplay features help offset overly-powerful scoring combos and layer additional attributes onto certain types of terrain, providing even greater depth of gameplay without sacrificing the original's signature elegance."
1432,"Agropolis can be played entirely on its own, but it can also combined with Sprawlopolis using special rules and goal cards provided in the Combopolis mini-expansion."
1433,Have you ever wondered who you would have been if your life had gone differently?
1433,How would you direct your life if everything were up to you?
1433,"Maybe you would be a magician, or travel around the world?"
1433,"Or maybe big business tempts you, and your goal would be to earn a million dollars?"
1433,"""CV"" means curriculum vitae – your resume – and in the dice and card game CV, you will lead a character through his entire life, making many choices about friends, relations, jobs, and activities."
1433,"Everything is possible: a dream job, new relationships, and skills."
1433,You can be whoever you want!
1433,Gameplay is built around the Yahtzee-style dice rolling and re-rolling system.
1433,"On their dice, players are trying to roll sets of symbols that allow them to acquire cards; each round, these cards give benefits of some kind, such as new symbols and special abilities."
1433,"At the end of the game, each kind of card scores points for the player."
1434,"Description from the publisher:
Dragonfire is a cooperative deck-building game set within the world of Dungeons & Dragons."
1434,"Players choose from a number of races — from dwarf to elf, half-orc to human — while assuming the quintessential roles of cleric, rogue, fighter, and wizard."
1434,"Equipped with weapons, spells, and magic items, players begin their adventure along the famed Sword Coast, then expand to other locales across the Forgotten Realms, such as Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep in future expansions."
1434,"Along the way, players level up their characters, opening access to additional equipment, feats, and more."

1435,"Humans have evolved into five different races, each of them adapted to life in different planetary conditions."
1435,"Guide one of the five human factions in its exploration of the galaxy, while exploiting resources, terraforming planets and creating advanced space colonies."
1435,You may even find artifacts of a long-lost alien civilization and use them to your advantage.
1435,"A game round consists of three phases: planning phase, action phase and end of round."
1435,"During the planning phase, action cards are placed face-down on any empty space of a shared planning board."
1435,"When all spaces on the board have been filled, the action phase begins."
1435,"In sequence, each card is revealed and all players may carry out the corresponding action."
1435,"At the end of round, the action cards are returned to the players' hands and a new round begins."
1435,"The available actions are:

Production: one of the resources depicted on the card is generated on every matching planet."
1435,Movement: starships may be moved to other planets by spending energy.
1435,"Build: colonies, factories, starships and terraformers may be built on the planets by using resource cards."
1435,Trade: resource cards may be traded among the players and the bank.
1435,Scoring: the players are scored based on one of the game elements depicted on the card.
1435,"The owner of each card has an advantage when resolving it, such as deciding which resource is generated or on which game element the players score."
1435,The game ends when one player reaches at least 50 victory points or when all planets have been discovered.
1435,"At that point, the player with the most victory points is the winner."
1436,"Indigo is a tile-laying game along the lines of Metro, Tsuro, and Linie 1 in which players build paths bit by bit, with no player owning the individual paths and everyone trying to exploit the paths already present."
1436,"Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move gemstones from their starting locations on the board to your designated goals, with the player who scores the most points winning the game."
1436,"To set up the game board, place the central hex tile, then add five green gems and one indigo gem to it."
1436,"Place six ""U-turn"" tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile."
1436,"Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player."
1436,"On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another."
1436,"Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges."
1436,"If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone ""moves"" as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone."
1436,(Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.)
1436,"When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection."
1436,"If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!"
1436,"When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem."
1436,"If two players own the goal, then both players collect a gem of that color, taking the extra gem needed from the reserve."
1436,"Once all the gems have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for an indigo gem, 2 for green, and 1 for yellow."
1436,The player with the most points wins.
1437,"“You are Victor Lavel, a young ambitious journalist working for a major newspaper."
1437,"It's the year 1900, the middle of the Belle Époque, and Paris flourishes."
1437,"There are so many stories to cover, the Exposition Universelle, the Summer Olympics, the opening of the first metro station, but as a Lavel, a family famous for solving crimes since the Middle Ages, you are much more interested in murders, kidnappings, and robberies."
1437,"Being a journalist helps you be among the first ones to know about them, and your wits often make you the first one to find the perpetrator.”
The new Chronicles of Crime: 1900 standalone game challenges players not only to skillfully collect evidence and interrogate suspects but also to solve some escape-room-style puzzles incorporated into each scenario."
1437,Can you guess the right combination to open the safe?
1437,Would you be able to decipher an encrypted message found on the crime scene?
1437,Can you trace the suspect by navigating a map?
1437,"It won’t be easy, but if you get stuck, you can ask your colleague Charlotte for help."
1437,"She runs the “Puzzles and Riddles” column in your newspaper, so she can always give you a hint about the mystery you’re struggling with."
1437,"Part of Chronicles of Crime - The Millennium Series
Chronicles of Crime is back with a range of games called ""The Millennium Series""."
1437,"Three brand new standalone Chronicles of Crime games, working with the same great system but providing interesting gameplay twists and refreshing universes that span an entire millennium from 1400 to 1900 and finally 2400."
1437,All three games are standalone but will offer connecting narrative threads for players to discover.
1437,-description from publisher
1438,"Two Lancastrians and two Yorkists draft cards that give them control of major towns, nobles, bishops and royal castles."
1438,"Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance."
1438,"Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king."
1438,"From the back of the box:

Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York."
1438,"Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right."
1438,"The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses."
1438,"Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country."
1438,"Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed."
1438,"As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King’s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London."
1438,"Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power."
1438,"When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base."
1438,Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King.
1438,"Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance."
1439,Oceanos is a game of underwater exploration with an original take on card-drafting.
1439,"Each player pilots her own submarine trying to spot the most underwater species and the largest coral reef, sending scuba-divers after forgotten treasures, collecting precious crystals to upgrade their ship and to escape the fearsome kraken's gaze...
Each submarine is divided into five parts, each of them independently upgradable from level 1 to level 3 and each one of them controlling a different ability of the player (however, there are no different abilities from one player to another)."
1439,"As there are multiple ways to score points and multiple takes on the submarine-upgrading order, the game offers several ways to win."
1439,"The whole game takes mere 15 turns, each one of them simultaneous between all players, which makes it a fairly quick family game."
1439,"Even though the submarines have the same abilities game-wise, each looks differently, and a special attention was obviously given also to the depiction of marine life."
1440,"In Aquaretto, the players are managing the planning and selection of animals for their water themed zoo, in the hope of acquiring the most victory points."
1440,The players can expand the size of their water park and victory points can be earned in a number of ways.
1440,The most common way is to collect a large number of animals to your park in a variety of species.
1440,The core of the game play is the decision to select another random animal from the draw bag to add to one of the transport trucks or to take a truck in play.
1440,Taking a truck requires a player to add the animals on their selected truck to their water zoo.
1440,"The catch is that animals need their space and thus different species cannot be placed adjacent to one another, there needs to be a separation."
1440,This then leads back to how the players decide to place animals on the trucks as they are drawn.
1440,"A player cannot afford to create a truck in which one player gets all the animals their park needs, so the aim is to place animals in such a way that a player gets something they want but also take some pain as well."
1440,"Aquaretto is a cousin to Zooloretto so there are other cute factors such as allowing animals to breed if a male and a female of a species are acquired, which allows the placement of a baby."
1440,There are also coin options that allow a player to do a range of things.
1440,Aquaretto can be played as a stand alone game or used in conjunction with Zooloretto for a mega-game of sorts.
1440,"It should be noted that Aquaretto is a slightly more involved experience than Zooloretto, with some more involved options, such as scoring bonuses for acquiring workers that interact with how many fish symbols a player has in their water park."
1441,"This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories."
1441,It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game.
1441,The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex.
1441,An optional second map extends to New Mexico.
1441,"There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn."
1441,"Each turn consists of an indefinite number of ""pulses"" and may last a long, long time."
1441,"Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels)."
1441,"The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders."
1441,"There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi."
1441,"Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary."
1441,"These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight."
1441,Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.
1441,"Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc."
1441,Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn.
1441,"In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of ""discretionary"" CP's that can be used in any Theater."
1441,The Union also gets Naval CP's.
1441,"Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below."
1441,Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses.
1441,"To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice."
1441,The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first).
1441,"Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play."
1441,"If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points."
1441,The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie.
1441,"If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered."
1441,"While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life."
1441,"Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command."
1441,Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted.
1441,"Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four."
1441,"Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank."
1441,"A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks."
1441,"Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative."
1441,(Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.)
1441,"Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static."
1441,"Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader."
1441,"(Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)"
1441,"The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater."
1441,Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side.
1441,"The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C."
1441,It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North.
1441,"Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end."
1441,"For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864."
1441,"The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail."
1441,Includes 520 counters.
1442,It's Einfach Genial/Ingenious in a 2-player travel version.
1442,The game is played on a hex board.
1442,"57 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes come with the game."
1442,There are symbols on each hex that makes up the piece (sometimes identical symbols).
1442,The pieces are drawn randomly in the game.
1442,"Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone."
1442,"The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colours."
1442,Points are claimed by placing a piece into any open space such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol.
1442,"So, for example, if a player places a piece with a purple circle on it such that it sits next to an unbroken line of four other purple circles already on the board, then the player scores four purple points."
1442,A newly placed symbol can lie next to at most five individual rows of symbols.
1442,Each player uses a scoring track to keep track of his points – one track for each colour going from 0 to 18.
1442,"If a player reaches the 18th space with any colour, then he gets to call out “Genial!” and take another turn."
1442,"At the end of their turn, players draw as many tiles out of the bag as required to bring their rack back up to six."
1442,The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board.
1442,Now each player looks to see how many points they scored in the colour they scored the least in.
1442,Whoever has the most points in their least-scored colour is the winner.
1442,"In the full game, there are 5 of each double and 6 of each pair of colors, the travel edition has 2 of each double and 3 of each pair."
1442,Einfach Genial - Reiseedition is part of the Kosmos two-player series.
1443,"Before winter makes its appearance, a particularly warm fall bathes the forest in a golden shimmer."
1443,"During the Indian Summer, New England blossoms one last time."
1443,"Treetops are ablaze with countless colors — a living rainbow, from green to orange to red."
1443,Slowly the first leaves are starting to fall.
1443,"Meanwhile, our steps and the diligent squirrels rustle the colorful foliage."
1443,"On our walks through the woods, we discover all kinds of little treasures; we collect berries, nuts, mushrooms and feathers."
1443,We pause for a moment to watch the shy inhabitants of the forest before we set off towards home once again.
1443,"There, a good book and a hot tea are already awaiting."
1443,"Indian Summer is the second part of Uwe Rosenberg's puzzle trilogy following 2016's Cottage Garden, and this game is firmly geared towards experienced players."
1443,At the heart of the game are puzzle tiles with holes that are placed on individual forest boards to cover up treasures.
1443,"When players get their hands on these, they gain more options and an edge over their opponents."
1443,All that counts in the end is to be the first to cover your forest floor completely with leaves.
1444,Pictures is a quick-playing family game with very simple rules.
1444,"Form the image on your secret picture card with one set of components, either shoelaces, color cubes, icon cards, sticks and stones or building blocks in such a way that the other players guess what image you have pictured:

 Pull out a marker from the bag that determines your secret picture card."
1444,Then form that image with your components in such a way that it is recognizable.
1444,And finally guess what image each other player has pictured.
1444,The players get points for correctly guessing other players images and for other players guessing their image.
1444,The most points wins!

1445,"Once the team has reached a solution and entered the correct code into the app, they will escape and win the game!"
1446,"In Piepmatz, you skillfully play bird cards from your hand to collect seeds and birds at the bird feeder."
1446,Seeds and mated pairs of birds in your collection are worth points.
1446,Single birds score only if you have the most of their species.
1446,The course of play is the same for all numbers of players.
1446,"On a turn, you go through these three phases in order:

Play a card — Select a bird card from your hand and place it face up at a perch of your choice."
1446,Resolve effects — Compare the birds on the ground with the bird at the perch.
1446,Take a seed card or add a bird to your collection.
1446,Move a bird to the feeder.
1446,Draw new cards — Replenish your hand.
1446,The game end is triggered when you are supposed to draw a card from an empty feeder deck.
1446,Play continues until all players have had an equal number of turns.
1446,Each player now chooses two bird cards from their hand and discards them face down.
1446,"Once all players have done this, add your remaining two bird cards to your collection and commence the scoring."
1446,"You score points for seeds, mated pairs of birds, and species majorities."
1446,Whoever has the most points wins.
1447,"The Battle of Britain, 1940

1448,"On your path, you stop before a damaged dungeon door."
1448,"It seems that great battles took place here, a sure sign of coveted treasure inside."
1448,You recognize this dungeon from the ballads sung in your village!
1448,"However, you’re not the only one who wants to enter, despite the warnings left around the entrance by the previous adventurers."

1448,Let the adventure begin!
1448,Welcome Back to the Dungeon is a simple and subtle push-your-luck game in which you’ll need to adopt a show of bravado or outwit your opponents!
1449,"The game consists of an ""arena"" (the game box with an insert) and lots of dice."
1449,The goal is to be the last player who still has dice.
1449,"At the beginning, one die is in the arena."
1449,The active player throws another die into the arena.
1449,"If both dice now show the same number, the player must take them out and end the turn."
1449,"If not, the player can decide to throw in another die (possibly trying to overturn other dice) or end his/her turn."
1449,"A die which shows the X face is removed from the game, as is any die which falls out of the arena."
1449,A player who holds no more dice is eliminated from the game.
1449,The last player who still has dice is the winner.
1450,Gregor Mendel is the 19th Century Augustinian Friar credited with the discovery of modern genetics.
1450,"In Genotype, you play as his assistants, competing to collect experimental data on pea plants by trying to control how the plants inherit key Traits from their parents: seed shape, flower color, stem color, and plant height."
1450,The observable Traits of a Pea Plant (its Phenotype) are determined by its genetic makeup (its Genotype).
1450,The relationship between Genotype and Phenotype and the nature of genetic inheritance are at the heart of Genotype: A Mendelian Genetics Game.
1450,"During the game, players get Pea Plant Cards which show a set of Phenotype Traits they hope to produce and collect (such as pink flowers and tall height) in order to score points."
1450,"Each round, Dice are rolled to represent Plant breeding, which may result in the Traits players are looking for."
1450,"After the Dice Roll, players take turns drafting Dice towards completing their Pea Plant Cards or advancing their Research."
1450,"The Traits produced during the Dice Roll come through the science of Punnett Squares, which show how the parent genes combine, one from each parent plant."
1450,"By changing the genes of these parent plants, players can influence the likelihood of rolling the Traits they need."
1450,The completion of Pea Plant Cards via the Dice Draft is the main way players score points.
1450,"Each round consists of 3 phases: Worker Placement, Dice Drafting, and Upgrades."
1450,"1) During Worker Placement, players take actions to get more Plant Cards, change the genes of a parent plant, Garden, Research, stake Phenotype claims, gather new Tools, or even position themselves ahead of other players for the Dice Drafting Phase in a couple of ways."
1450,"2) Dice Drafting features a couple of interest steps, including the possibility to get first pick of dice, but only for one type of Trait (like plant height), or the possibility to get a pick of any dice, but only after those first picks have happened."
1450,De Novo Mutation Dice allow players to change the Trait of other Dice or gain additional Research.
1450,"3) The Upgrades phase lets players spend their Research to gain upgrades that let them work on more Plant Cards, draft more Dice each round, or gain additional Workers to be used during the Worker Placement Phase of each round."
1450,Players work to match their Pea Plant Cards to the outcome of the Dice Draft and complete the cards for points.
1450,"If they've placed a Phenotype marker, they will earn bonus points for every completed card that matches their claim."
1450,"At the end of 5 rounds, the player with the most points wins."

1452,"Bloodborne: The Card Game is based on the Chalice Dungeons in the video game Bloodborne — the ever-changing labyrinths and tombs carved out by the Great Ones beneath the fallen city of Yharnam, where horrifying creatures reside."
1452,Players compete to kill monsters and take their blood.
1452,"In general, Bloodborne is a game about risk management with a bit of group think, inventory management/upgrades, and tactical play."
1452,"You start with a hand of basic weapons, which you get to upgrade to improve your fighting combos and capabilities."
1452,"Each turn, one monster chosen at random attacks players, who fight back as a team, with everyone playing a card from their hand simultaneously to attempt to kill the monster."
1452,"Players collect blood from the monster, assuming it dies, based on how much damage they dealt."
1452,Monsters can fight back with exploding dice that can potentially deal infinite damage.
1452,"Players can fight as long as they want, but if they die in combat, they lose their progress."
1452,Players can opt out of fighting to bank their blood and save it permanently.
1452,Collected blood counts as victory points.
1452,"Says designer Eric M. Lang, ""My goal with Bloodborne was to channel the intensity and frustration of the video game into a contest between players."
1452,"Lots of death."""
1453,Navajo Wars is a solitaire card driven game which places the player into the role of the Diné (Navajo) from the time of the Spanish incursion in 1595 through the time of their subjugation at the hands of an American Army led by Kit Carson in 1864.
1453,“Diné” (pronounced 'dih-nay') is the word the Navajo use to refer to their tribe.
1453,"It means “the people.”
The term, “Navajo”  comes from a Spanish rendering of a Tewa (one of the Pueblo tribes) word for “planted fields.” The Diné were and are still known for their planting of corn in the high desert of New Mexico and Arizona."
1453,"The objective for the Navajo player, hereinafter referred to as ""player"", is to avoid being subjugated by either the Spanish, Mexicans or the Americans, hereinafter referred to as ""enemy""."
1453,The player will be taking actions during the course of the game to try and increase both culture and military tracks.
1453,"If both of those reach zero at any time during the game, you will be subjugated by the enemy and immediately lose the game."
1453,"There are also cultural developments, in the form of a tech tree, that the player will have to develop to increase his chances of winning."
1453,"The developments are; weaving, horsemanship, religion, masters of the Mesas and sharp trades each having three levels of development."
1453,Navajo Wars also has historical event cards for each period.
1453,These cards have their own rules and effects that really add a historical feel to the game.
1453,"As the player, you will be trying to get your family units, ""counter"" on the map."
1453,"Your family units could consist of a man, woman and child."
1453,With those counters you will be conducting individual actions with your families that are on the map.
1453,"These actions could include, raids on New Mexico, raids on an outpost, tribal warfare & tribal diplomacy both conducted against the Comanche or the Ute."
1453,"Create trade goods, husbandry and travel."
1453,"During the enemy portion of the turn, the enemy will be conducting operations against the Navajo tribe."
1453,"These operations could include: to subvert the natives (player), build outpost, build and subvert, raids (the enemy will try to send raids deep into the Navajo territory) and many other actions."
1453,The enemy receives their orders by a unique order matrix.
1453,"As the player, you are never sure what will be coming next."
1453,"Navajo Wars can be played as individual scenarios for the Spanish, Mexican and American periods."
1453,You can play all three periods as a campaign game.
1454,"Come aboard and sail to Pirate's Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers."
1454,The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea.
1454,"Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas."
1454,Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen.
1454,"To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly."
1454,You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern.
1454,"At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!"
1454,"The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit."
1454,All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved.
1454,"If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues."
1454,Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice).
1454,The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island.
1454,"If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty."
1454,"If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn."
1454,"Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out."
1454,"Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards."
1454,"The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty."
1454,"Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship."
1454,Each Island offers a different ship component.
1454,"The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons."
1454,(The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).
1454,There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game.
1454,The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship.
1454,Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).
1454,Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order.
1454,"One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated."
1454,"If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons."
1454,"However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame!"
1454,"But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands."
1454,"At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell ""tall tales"" about themselves to increase their final fame standings."
1454,"These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun ""pirate"" mechanic."
1454,"In all, Pirate's Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory."
1455,"With a piece of land to call your own, a handful of resources, a few families and a head full of dreams you embark on a journey of a lifetime."
1455,Beyond lies the New World full of opportunities to make your dreams of a new home a reality.
1455,"But beware, other settlers have come here as well, and although their beginnings are as humble as yours, each of them will want to influence these new lands as much as you."
1455,Will you become the most powerful?
1455,"Dice Settlers is a civilization dice game of pool building, resource gathering and area control."
1455,"Each turn players reach into their bags of dice, roll and choose their own actions: from exploring new lands and building the board, through gathering resources and trading, to developing technologies which offer new abilities, each player chooses their own path to victory."
1455,"A changing board, a set of different technologies every time you play, and a vast array of available strategies await!"
1456,"Of Japanese origins, Shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board, and the object is to capture the opponent's king."
1456,There are two main differences with Western chess.
1456,"First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows."
1456,"Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can ""parachute"" or ""drop"" them back to the board instead of performing a normal move."
1456,"Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame."
1456,"However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare."
1456,"According to ""A World of Chess"" by Jean-Louis Cazaux & Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century."
1456,Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi.
1456,This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi).
1456,"The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today."
1457,"Walnut Grove borrows ideas from jigsaw puzzles and worker placement games, as players add tiles to their farm, and perform actions in the city."
1457,"Each player manages their farm over 8 years, expanding their plots each spring, harvesting each summer, doing business in the city each fall, and hunkering down each winter."
1457,"Each worker must be fed, and provided with heat."
1457,Walnut Grove could be described as drawing inspiration from Carcassonne (tile laying) and Agricola (running a farm).
1457,"The goal of the game is to build and run own farm, to score points at the end of the game."
1457,"Players can improve their farm during the game by adding new land tiles to it, hiring more workers, building improvements, etc
The game play is divided into eight years, and each year is divided into Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter phases."
1457,"During Spring, players add 1 or 2 land tiles to their farm."
1457,"During Summer, players position their workers in their fields to gather resources."
1457,"When Autumn comes, all players get to visit the city."
1457,"Finally, during the Winter phase, players need to feed their workers and heat their homes."
1457,"When placing tiles, their sides do not need to match."
1457,"But you generally want them to, because each land area will produce resources based on its size, when you send a worker there."
1457,"In the city you can hire more workers, sell goods to gain coins, build improvements, and so on."
1457,Each player may do only one action in the city each year.
1457,The city is a kind of rondel that is divided into halves; each time you cross the midline you have to pay a coin.
1457,"Therefore it is wise to move as slowly as possible on the rondel, but then again, you have consider what actions you want to take!"
1457,"This part of the game is worker placement with a single worker, since you can only move to a vacant space."
1457,"Spring, Summer and Winter phases can be done simultaneously, providing fast game play."
1457,"This is a very tight game, with limited actions and scarce resources."
1457,Solo rules are included.
1458,"As vast and dark as a sunless void, the Blackstone Fortress is a creation far beyond the ken of any race in the galaxy."
1458,"In this age of darkness, in a galaxy riven with strife and horror, the desperate and intrepid alike search this Fortress for long-lost technologies that may be used to turn the tide of war."
1458,"In Warhammer Quest Blackstone Fortress, you and your friends take on the role of a group of disparate explorers delving into the labyrinthine halls of a vast and ancient space station."
1458,Only by working together and balancing your strength and skills can you hope to survive.
1458,"With each expedition, you will discover powerful archeotech and learn more of the Blackstone Fortress’ closely guarded secrets, including, perhaps, the location of its greatest treasure."
1458,"The game can be played solo, or with up to 4 friends, with the fifth player controlling the hostiles."
1458,"At the end of each expedition, the players return to the nearby port city of Precipice to rest, recuperate, and trade their loot for resources that will aid in their next adventure."

1468,"Tiles may also be placed on existing types of tiles, forming a 3D structure in front of you."
1468,Covering two of the same symbol is extremely valuable as it provides a bonus gingerbread or action.

1468,"In the end, the player with the most victory points wins."

1469,Origin of the Game: Ogre / G.E.V..

1473,Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace that looks remarkably like a plain matrix for square tiles.
1473,"Each turn, players place tiles onto the board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column."
1473,"Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins."

1476,"A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you’ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure."
1476,What you haven’t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it.
1476,Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they’ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga.
1476,But you’ve seen your friends’ loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny.
1476,You know that nobody can be trusted.
1476,Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players.
1476,"In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed."
1476,"In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves."
1476,"Since nobody holds a ""hand"" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards."

One player is Dr. Jekyll ; the other is Mr. Hyde."
1478,The game plays in three rounds.
1478,"At the end of each round, Dr. Jekyll's identity will progressively disappear under Mr. Hyde's relentless attacks."
1478,"Compare the number of tricks that each player has won in this round and subtract the lowest score from the highest one (for instance, if Dr. Jekyll won 6 tricks and Mr. Hyde won 4 tricks, then the final result is 6-4=2)."
1478,This result indicates by how many spaces the Identity Marker will move to Mr. Hyde's side.
1478,Evil is relentless!
1478,"Even if Dr. Jekyll won more tricks that Mr. Hyde, the marker will progress towards Mr. Hyde's side."
1478,"As Dr. Jekyll, your goal is to keep balance, without giving in to darkness!"
1478,"If the marker reaches the last space of the track (far left), then Mr. Hyde instantly wins the game."

1478,Mr. Hyde wins as soon as the Identity Marker reaches the last space of the Identity Track (far left).

1479,"Whoever you choose to play, you’ve got just two weeks to solve the murder, uncover the conspiracy, and face your personal demons."
1479,"During a round, the players get action points to spend on various actions, like moving their detectives, following leads that appear on locations, solving their personal demons, or doing a location-specific action."
1479,"In this way, the detectives try to advance on three different sectors: solving the murder, uncovering the conspiracy behind the murder, and finding their inner peace."
1479,"To solve the murder, the detectives follow leads that appear on New Angeles and Heinlein, and find evidence that they plant on the suspect of their choice."
1479,"The conspiracy puzzle is also solved by following leads, and may alter the way victory points are distributed at the end of the game."
1479,"Finally, each detective has his/her own personal plots that are resolved gradually throughout the game."

1485,Mystery of the Abbey is a whodunit deduction game in the spirit of Clue.
1485,A monk has been murdered in a medieval French Abbey.
1485,Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.
1485,"Monks are of three orders, fat-thin, bald-hatted, bearded-clean shaven."
1485,"One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed."
1485,"Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there."
1485,"(For instance, ""how many fat monks do you have?"".)"
1485,"Players may either take a ""vow of silence"" or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question."
1485,"""Mass"" occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor."
1485,"Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g."
1485,"in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later."
1485,"Unlike Clue you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations."
1485,"So, e.g."
1485,a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.
1485,"Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions."
1486,This description was originally based on a review from BoardgameNews.com.
1486,"In this corporation-themed game, players compete to be the first to acquire four out of six possible victory points."
1486,"You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track."
1486,You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.
1486,"The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns."
1486,"At the meeting, the ""company chairman"" is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the ""division heads"" are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes)."
1486,Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.
1486,"The player who's the ""communications"" head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round)."
1486,"Other heads' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits."
1486,"After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as ""hiring and relocating employees"" (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards."
1486,These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock).
1486,"A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers' happiness scale)."
1486,"In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track."
1486,"A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns."
1486,"It's not a business simulation, and gameplay isn't as dastardly as the theme implies."
1486,The event cards provide most of the humor.
1486,"(The card may read that you have failed to fix the breakroom game table, or vacations were canceled, so worker satisfaction goes down, which is what you want)."
1486,"The feel of rising through the ranks (getting more points) is there, and there are many things to attempt to excel in, by doing various business-related (at least in name) actions."
1486,"Efficient manipulating of your opportunities will win you victory points and, if you gain four, the game."
1486,"Awards: 
Machtspiele (Power $truggle) is derived from ""Die Firma"", which won a special prize in the 2009 Hippodice game design competition for best full-length game."
1487,"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts)."
1487,"Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck."
1487,"There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the ""price of the bottle."""
1487,"The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle."
1487,"As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit)."
1487,The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.
1487,"Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered ""trump"" and will win the trick."
1487,"If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick."
1487,"Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase."
1487,Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.
1487,One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).
1487,"Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand."
1487,Play continues until the point goal is reached.
1487,In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L.
1487,Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English & German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.
1487,Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.
1488,Zombies are attacking the entire town!
1488,Cooperate with your friends and launch an expedition to drive off the overwhelming hordes.
1488,"Collect the four ingredients, and brew the antidote that will save the world!"
1488,Zombie Teenz Evolution is the sequel to Zombie Kidz Evolution (#1 Kids' Game on BGG).
1488,"It is a standalone game with a different set of rules, so you don’t need to have played the first game to jump into the second."
1488,The rules are slightly more advanced and will require a little more strategic thinking.
1488,"Zombie Teenz Evolution follows the same general guidelines as its predecessor: a fast and simple game whose rules evolve from game to game through the opening of 14 ""mystery"" envelopes."
1488,"By accomplishing special missions, players unlock additional content that will provide a richer experience, while constantly renewing the enjoyment of the game."
1488,The icing on the cake: the two games are compatible!
1488,"You will be able to play Zombie Kidz with your Zombie Teenz, and vice versa!"

1490,Rise of Empires is an empire-building game in which players develop their ever changing empire from Ancient Age to Modern Age.
1490,"War, economics, science and diplomacy are to be taken into consideration to successfully win this epic game."
1490,In Rise of Empires two to five players are building their own civilization from the dawn of history to present times.
1490,"All players start small and fairly powerless, however, through clever play they try to gain wealth and progress in several areas."
1490,"Like many empire building games, it is possible to be wiped from the board one turn, only to return the next in another area."
1490,Rise of Empires is divided into three eras.
1490,Each era consists of two game turns.
1490,The core of the game is the Action Display where players conduct various actions during a turn.
1490,"The first turn in an era is called the A turn, the second one the B turn."
1490,"In a way, the B turn is a mirror image of the A turn."
1490,The aim of the game is to have the most victory points at the end.
1490,"Victory points are scored by building cities, having an empire (area control), developing technology, and trading goods."
1490,"In contrast to some other civilization type games, Rise of Empires plays fairly quickly."
1490,A full game can be completed in less than three hours.
1490,"It is also more abstract than many civ games, in that cities, towns, and technologies are represented by tiles the players keep, even if their civilization is buried in the sands of time."
1490,"Publisher Blurb:
Don't just make history-guide it!"
1490,"Take the reins of a developing civilization, choosing the resources and development paths that will lead to the fastest expansion, as you claim and defend territory on a map forging an empire that eventually encompasses whole continents."
1490,Rise of Empires play is divided into three eras.
1490,"Choices made early in the era are repeated late, so your decisions must have both short-term and long-term benefits to be successful."
1490,This process requires tough decision-making and promotes an atmosphere with nail-biting suspense.
1490,"Victory points are rewarded for building cities, having an empire, for progress in science, and for trading goods."
1490,Rise of Empires breathes new life into the civilization games genre!
1490,"Balance gold and food, war and agriculture, territory and technology to forge an empire that is destined to rise above all other nations!"
1490,"Each copy of Rise of Empires contains:
."

1491,They gazed at the large structure of colorful blocks neatly stacked before them.
1491,The goal was simple: climb to the highest level possible.
1491,Getting there was more challenging than originally thought.
1491,Only one climber will make it to the top.
1491,Will it be you?
1491,Your goal is to climb to the highest level of the structure.
1491,"To help with your climb, you may move and rotate blocks."
1491,Ladders can be used to climb large distances.
1491,Your blocking disk will prevent other players from using a specific block.
1491,Use your tools wisely and at the right time to make the best possible moves in your adventure to the top!
1492,"As the Chief of a Himalayan high plateau tribe; Dolpo-pa, Bhotia, Sherpa, or Tamang, you lead your yak's caravan from one village to another through snowy crests and risky paths in order to collect the goods necessary to the development of your tribe."
1492,"Meanwhile, you will increase the political, religious and economical influence of your tribe."
1492,"By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock."
1492,All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!
1492,"Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them."
1492,"Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage."
1492,Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.
1492,"Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks."
1492,"The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with)."
1492,"To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board."
1492,Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.
1492,The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.
1492,This unusual scoring is what makes this game different from many other similar games.
1493,The Red Dragon Inn 2 is a standalone game that can be combined with the original The Red Dragon Inn to create adventuring parties of up to eight drunken players.
1493,"The Red Dragon Inn 2 includes its own drink deck, player mats, counters, Gold, markers, and the following heroic adventurers:

Dimli the Dwarf: Grumpy, but tough and loyal, Dimli always seems to have a stash of gold secreted away somewhere."
1493,He can pretty much drink anyone else under the table.
1493,"He's really, really good with his matched set of dwarven axes."
1493,"He's not so good with darts, though."
1493,"When he starts playing, duck."
1493,"Eve the Illusionist: Eve defies description, mostly because we don't know what she really looks like."
1493,Her powers of illusion have saved her friends countless times from the extremely gullible monsters of the deep dungeon.
1493,She's been known to use her skills on her fellow party members when she gets bored.
1493,"Fleck the Bard: Fleck is a dashing half-elf, ready with a smile or a song."
1493,"His heroic tales and stirring lute-playing raises his friends' spirits, filling them with courage as they face the horrors of the deep dungeon."
1493,"Fleck is always up for carousing, no matter the day or night."
1493,All the girls think he's so dreamy.
1493,Gog the Half-Ogre: A hulking brute from the flinty mountains who unfortunately doesn't know his own strength.
1493,"He's not the brightest torch in the dungeon, but he's a nice guy and he tries hard."
1493,"Never, ever dance with Gog."
1494,"Aim of the game from the rulebook:
The goal of the game is to build the most successful Underground lines and in doing so gain the most points."
1494,"You can gain points by connecting your lines to various destinations on the board, and by having the passenger use your lines to travel from station to station."
1494,The player who has best balanced the demands by the time that the deck of destinations is exhausted will be declared the winner.
1494,"Gameplay overview:
In On the Underground, the players represent companies building underground lines in London."
1494,Each player controls 2-4 different lines (based on the number of players).
1494,"On each turn, a player can build four pieces of track on the map in any of their color."
1494,All track pieces must extend the color.
1494,"Alternatively, a player may decide to use two branch tokens (acquired by extending lines to the terminus stations or skipping building turns) to branch out of the line."
1494,"During the track building part, the active player can score in four different ways:

 Connect their line to a station with a National Rail symbol (1p)
 Connect their line to a terminus station (2p + a branch token)
 Connect two connection tokens of the same type (3p)
 Building a circular line (1p for each station ""inside"" the line)

After each turn, the passenger moves to one or two of the four face up destination cards; first to one express destination and then to a regular destination."
1494,"If there are no cards face up in either type, the passenger only moves once."
1494,"The passenger always uses the shortest route from their current position, avoiding walking and line changes."
1494,The passenger scores one point for each line they used to get to their destination.
1494,"When there is not enough destination cards to turn face up from the deck, the passenger marker is removed from the game."
1494,"Players get equal turns, but after the passenger marker is removed, no more points are awarded from passenger movement and players can only build track."
1494,The player with the highest amount of points wins.
1495,In Marrakech each player takes the role of a rug salesperson who tries to outwit the competition.
1495,Each player starts with 10 coins and an equal number of carpets.
1495,"On your turn, you may rotate Assam 90 degrees."
1495,"Then roll the die and move him forward as many spaces as showing (d6: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4)."
1495,"If Assam reaches the edge of the board, follow the curve and continue moving in the next row."
1495,"If Assam lands on another player's carpet, you must pay that player 1 coin per square showing that is contiguous with the landed-on square."
1495,"Then, you place one of your carpets orthogonally adjacent to Assam (but may not directly overlay another carpet)."
1495,The game ends when all players have played all carpets.
1495,Each gets 1 coin per visible square.
1495,The player with most coins wins!
1496,Gleaming monuments and sunrise vistas await your arrival as you traverse the globe to experience its many wonders.
1496,"Will you explore ancient ruins deep in the jungle, or go wild on a savanna safari?"
1496,"Build your bucket list of destinations and take a whirlwind tour to visit them all - but hurry, your fellow travelers might just beat you there!"
1496,In Trekking the World 2-5 players compete to be the ultimate globe trotter by racing to visit world-renowned locations and collect rare souvenirs along the way.
1496,"The game spotlights 48 real-world destinations, each beautifully illustrated and accompanied with educational passages to inspire your next getaway."

1497,"Taken from Boardgame News:
Oregon is a family/strategy game with a colonization-theme and a card-driven placement mechanism."
1497,The aim of the game is to position farmers and point-giving buildings in the best possible locations on the board.
1497,The year is 1846.
1497,"Gunslingers, lawmen, pioneers, and whole families left their homes in the east and midwest to try their luck in the West."
1497,"They loaded their covered wagons with all they could and headed west across steppes, deserts, and mountains."
1497,"Many chose to settle in Oregon, where the farming and hunting were plentiful, and they could stake out a bit of land for themselves."
1497,The players have already reached Oregon and gaze upon the rich farmland below and the potential gold and coal reserves of the mountains.
1497,"They build ports on the lakes and rivers, churches, warehouses, post offices, and train stations on the plains."
1497,"And, of course, they must farm the rich land to grow the food necessary for the area to grow and thrive."
1497,"To win, a player must choose the right times to farm and the right times to build, for planning is necessary, even here in the untamed wilderness of Oregon!"
1497,Oregon - the way the west was won...
1498,"In remote times, King Gradlon had the magnificent city of Ys erected for his daughter Dahut."
1498,Gargantuan sea-walls protected the city from the violent waves.
1498,"Dahut decided to make Ys the most powerful place in Brittany; thus, she dispatched dragons to seize merchant ships loaded with jewels which sailed on the open sea…
Each turn, ships filled with gems land in the city's ports."
1498,"The players, embodying merchant-princes of Ys, set their team to work, two at a time, in the 4 neighborhoods of the city; deciding which area of each neighborhood to focus on."
1498,"Controlling the port to claim special black jewels, the commercial area to gain a financial advantage or the palace to influence characters of influence."
1498,However it is the player who dominates the neighborhood as a whole who has the first choice of the precious stones carried in the hold of the ship docked there.
1498,"Don't overlook the gem market as other players may send their brokers to influence the value of the different types of jewels, making your collection less valuable."
1498,Each player has a team of 11 brokers of varying skill levels.
1498,"These brokers are placed on the players turn, one face up and one face down."
1498,"Bluff your opponents on where your intentions lie, misdirection is the key to victory."
1498,"At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has accumulated the most gold (represented by victory points)."
1499,"The Initiative — a unique co-operative board game of story, strategy, and code-breaking — lets players take on the role of teenagers in 1994 who have found a mysterious board game called ""The Key""."
1499,"Not only will they play The Key, but players will help the teens through a pivotal chapter of their lives by following a series of missions linked together via an interactive comic book."
1499,"The game's campaign is broken into a number of chapters, each taking 30-60 minutes to complete and each starting with you reading a page of the comic book."
1499,"The story advances even if players fail a mission, but winning may provide a reward in the future."
1499,"Each chapter builds on the knowledge and story from previous chapters, weaving narrative, code-breaking, and mystery into one thrilling game experience."
1500,A light card game where players gain status by going out first.
1500,"The 80-card commercial deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jesters."
1500,"Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck."
1500,"In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1."
1500,"The lower the number, the better the rank."
1500,The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible.
1500,The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table.
1500,"The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards)."
1500,"Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass."
1500,"Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round."
1500,"After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked."
1500,"For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti."
1500,Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.
1500,The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.
1500,"Similar to:

Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle
Pyramid Card 
Scum: The Food Chain Game 
Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game"
1501,"The game is for 2 teams, divided into two approximately equivalent number of players and takes about 30 minutes to play."
1501,"It could remind you of the classic word game known as Taboo, but this one has an interesting twist on gameplay – the opposing team is the one who chooses the words you cannot use."
1501,"With you having no idea which words are ""traps"", it’s like dancing on a minefield, when you’re trying to describe your assigned word to the rest of the team."
1501,"You take the role of a group of adventurers crawling through a fantasy dungeon full of traps and curses, with a Boss waiting for you at the end."
1501,You have to successfully guess a word that one of your teammates is trying to describe to you.
1501,"Sounds simple, but it is made fiendishly difficult by not knowing which words you can't say."
1501,"Because both teams are simultaneously preparing secret traps for each other, words that you can't use."
1501,"And further you get, the more trapwords you might expect."
1501,"Let's see the example of one possible turn when you are trying to give clues for the word ""Axe"":
You: ""It is a thing that a dwarf can…""
Opponents team: ""A-ha, dwarf!"
1501,"Gotcha!"""
1501,"You: ""How did you know that?"
1501,"Was it obvious I will use that?"""
1501,"Or when you would try another approach it could look like this, the successful turn of your team:
You: ""This thing is used by a man with a beard, in a checkered shirt....""
One of your teammates: ""A coffee maker?"""
1501,"[Everyone laughs]
You: ""He uses it for work in nature."""
1501,"Another teammate: ""A chainsaw!"""
1501,"You: ""He makes smaller pieces from a big plant with it."""
1501,"Any of your teammate: ""An axe!"""
1501,"You: ""Yes!"
1501,"Very good!"""
1501,Could you avoid your opponent's trapwords when you don't know what you can't say?
1502,Thousands of coffee farmers all over the world support their families by using small stretches of hillside land for their coffee plantations.
1502,"Farmers work day in and day out for very little, but the future of coffee farming is bright."
1502,Fair Trade organizations strive to improve living conditions for these farmers by helping them set up cooperatives.
1502,"This enables them to establish better pricing agreements and take out loans for new plantations, all to help provide education and improve the quality of their lives, families, societies, and environment."
1502,"In Coffee Traders, set in 1970s Central and South America, Africa, and Asia, the delicious Arabica coffee beans farmers harvest are sold in Antwerp — and all over the world — to coffee roasters large and small."
1502,Work with your competitors to develop the regions you see fit for the best coffee beans while keeping a watchful eye on the market.
1502,Construct buildings to help your Fair Trade coffee plantations thrive while enhancing your network for trading coffee.
1502,"Will your plantations fall to ruin, or will you rise to the top and become the world's greatest coffee trader?"

1503,"When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC, he left no clear heir to the immense empire he had conquered."
1503,It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire.
1503,By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms.
1503,Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars.
1503,Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill.
1503,Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards.
1503,Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer.
1503,Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment.
1503,The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia.
1503,Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers.
1503,The Tyche cards have received the most changes—nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.
1503,"In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved."
1503,Years of questions and answers on Consimworld have been used to clarify the rules.
1503,"The rules also include hints on strategy from a number of long-time Successors players, and an extended example of play."
1504,Axis & Allies (2004) aka Axis & Allies Revised Edition is the first Avalon Hill version of the classic light weight war game Axis & Allies.
1504,The game simulates the entire scope of World War II.
1504,"The game is nominally designed for five players, representing the Allies: United States of America, United Kingdom and Russia vs. the Axis: Germany and Japan."
1504,"However, it is most often played as a two-player game."
1504,"Axis & Allies features a simple dice-based combat system; a small number of types of naval, air and land units; territory control; and technology research to improve unit capabilities."
1504,Major new features of Axis & Allies (2004) include new units (e.g.
1504,"destroyers, artillery), revised unit capabilities (e.g."
1504,"armor defend at 3, fighters cost 10 IPCs), directed technology research, and totally new victory conditions (key territories must be controlled to win the game)."
1505,"New York, 1929: A frenzy of interest in antiquity is sweeping the nation!"
1505,With museums hungry for mysterious and exotic artifacts — and you hungry for adventure — you start up your own archeology company.
1505,"Untold wonders await within dangerous jungles, harsh deserts, and wind-swept mountains."
1505,Will you gain a reputation as the most intrepid and famous adventurer of all time?
1505,"In Artifacts, Inc., 2-4 players compete to grow the most famous archaeology company."
1505,"Players roll dice, which represent their troop of adventurers, and place them on cards in order to find artifacts, sell them to museums, and purchase new cards representing their company assets."
1505,"Players can choose to focus on making lots of money by selling artifacts, having museum majorities, creating the best combination of expeditions and buildings, or searching below the waves for lost cities and hidden treasures."
1505,"The first player to reach 20 reputation triggers the end of the game, and the player with the most total reputation wins!"

1507,Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash.
1507,Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure words.
1507,"Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix:  Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for)."
1507,"The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs."
1507,The UK version of Absolute Balderdash is a different variation with different questions.
1507,"Notably, the UK Absolute Balderdash features a ""Law"" category, where you complete the law given on the card."
1507,"Beyond Balderdash is lacking that category, and features in its place a ""Date"" category, where you are given a date and must come up with the historical significance."
1507,The Canadian and Australian versions of Absolute Balderdash also feature the Date category instead of Law.
1507,Absolute and Beyond were merged into the game Balderdash at least by 2003 (there is a 1997 edition of Beyond Balderdash still with the Dates category).
1507,"Now, the vanilla version of Balderdash is the five-category edition with Laws instead of Dates."
1507,Balderdash with a single category (word definitions) has not existed since at least 2003.
1507,"Re-implemented by:

1508,"Circles, triangles, squares and diamonds: Drop It is about letting go, with the pieces you drop landing somewhere in the vertical game board, ideally where they'll score the most points, but the tiles bounce around and don't always land where you expect them to!"
1508,"In more detail, each turn the active player drops one of their pieces into the slot of the game board."
1508,"The player scores points for the highest level that the piece touches and for any special locations that it touches, but if the piece touches anything of the same shape or color, then you score nothing!"
1508,"What's more, certain pieces are forbidden at certain spots on the edge of the playing area."
1508,The Drop It rulebook includes variant rules for simpler play or more variety from game to game.
1509,"(from ADG website :)
World in Flames is Australian Design group's international award winning game that is the strategic game of World War II."

1509,"[...]Counters represent the armies and corps, the aircraft carriers, the naval task forces and the air groups that took part."
1509,Everything you need to re-fight the greatest conflict in history.
1509,Two to six players make the strategic decisions that decide the fate of nations.

1510,Renature is a majority game with dominoes for 2-4 players.
1510,"Each player gets a board with large pieces of wood in the form of turf, bushes, pines and oaks."
1510,These plants are used for the majorities on the large valley board and are available in a neutral color and in the respective player color.
1510,"In addition, each player gets a stack of dominoes with two out of ten animal motifs on each of them."
1510,"On your turn, place one of the three dominoes in your hand on two brook spaces of the valley board."
1510,"Of course, the domino must be adjacent to another domino that shows the same animal."
1510,"If the placed domino borders a free space of a brown area, you can decide whether a tuft of grass or any other of your plants should be placed on that space."
1510,"Tufts of turf have a value of 1, bushes of 2, pines of 3 and oaks of 4."
1510,"After placing the plant, you score points for it and every plant piece that is already in this brown area and has the same or a lower value."
1510,"Once a brown area is framed with dominoes, the majority is scored and the player with the highest total plant value in the area gets the points that are printed as a large number on that area's flower token."
1510,Whoever has the second highest value gets the lower number.
1510,Two things make this especially tricky: The neutral pieces count as their own color and not among the majority of the player who has used them.
1510,"Also, if colors are tied, they a treated as though they are not present at all in the area."
1510,"After the area has been scored, the player who framed the area receives its flower token, which will give them extra points at game end."
1510,"In the course of the game, you may run out of plants, but these can be bought back from the game board with clouds."
1510,Clouds can also be used to buy another turn and to appoint a new joker animal.
1510,This animal then counts as all animals and makes it easier to put on.
1510,"At the end of a player's turn, a domino is drawn and it is the next player's turn."
1510,"Once all players have run out of dominoes, the game ends with a final scoring."

1514,"In Otys,  each player has a team of divers and must use them to take actions, retrieve items, and complete objectives."
1514,"The divers are stacked in a column on the player's individual game board, and some of them are next to depth gauges that read 1-5."
1514,"On a turn, a player chooses an available depth gauge on their individual board, then carries out the action at that same depth on the shared game board, then takes the action for their diver at that depth."
1514,"Afterward that diver moves to the surface, pushing down all the other divers in the queue."
1514,"That depth gauge is placed at the bottom of the player's board, and they return to the player's board to be chosen again only when that player's gauge meter is full."
1514,"Initially a player must play all six of their gauges before getting any back, but they can improve their meter so that it takes fewer gauges to fill, thereby giving them more choices for their actions."
1514,"As divers obtain items, those items are kept at the appropriate depth on a player's board, and when a player has the needed items together at the same depth, they can claim one of the shared objectives revealed on the table or one of their personal objectives (if they've taken any)."

1515,—description from the publisher
1516,"The world of Midgaard, created by author Jarosław Grzędowicz in The Lord of the Ice Garden novel series, is inhabited by a race very similar to humans, filled with magic and for a reason stuck at the cultural and technological level of medieval Viking world."
1516,The arrival of scientists from Earth disturbs its fragile balance.
1516,The power gained by controlling magic changes the scientists – they become possessed by the lust for making this world better.
1516,"They become gods, who are willing to sacrifice any life, except for their own, of course, to accomplish their – great, according to them – ideas."
1516,"Players impersonate the scientists struggling for the domination over The Coast of Sails and also for staying on Midgaard, because soon after them another person arrives to this world: Vuko Drakkainen, highly trained agent, whose task is to find the members of scientific expedition and send them back to Earth — or as a last resort make them vanish."
1516,"Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?"
1516,"From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war."
1516,"They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle."
1516,"They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying."
1516,"The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions."
1516,The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions.
1516,A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it.
1516,"Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals."
1516,Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.
1516,Olaf Fjollsfinn – uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.
1516,Passionaria Callo – sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them.
1516,She needs to isolate two of them.
1516,Pier van Dyken – greedy collector of M-factor.
1516,"When he dominates a region with  a magical reserve, he may move it towards his headquarters, The Thorn."
1516,He needs to absorb four magical reserves.
1516,Ulrike Freihoff – spreads her religion.
1516,"When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there."
1516,Six of those grant her victory.
1516,"There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess."
1516,"Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence."
1516,Such a visit is nothing nice – Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.
1516,"The game may end in one of the three ways:

Meeting the player's unique victory condition – the game ends and that player is the winner,
After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,
The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track – each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard."
1516,"If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation."
1516,"INITIATIVE PHASE:
During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase."
1516,"Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens."
1516,In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.
1516,"PLANNING PHASE:
Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields."
1516,"ACTION PHASE:
Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens."
1516,• Viper's Nest – player receives one token of any resource.
1516,They can also exchange resources.
1516,"• Influence – player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence
• Move – player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)
• Voracious Mountain – player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region
• Raven's Shadow – player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko."
1516,"• Magic – allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit."
1516,Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.
1516,• Activation (automatic field) – after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units.
1516,The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined.
1516,After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.
1516,• Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) – each turn Vuko must go to another region.
1516,"Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence."
1516,"That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any)."
1516,"In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game."
1516,"DOMINATION PHASE:
Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals."

1517,"If you want to establish new cities, you’ll build schooners or airships to reach faraway lands and flying islands."
1517,"Your cities have limited capacity, so you’ll have to decide what to keep and what to demolish when building advanced structures."

1519,It is named after the year the New York Stock Exchange opened at 40 Wall Street in New York.
1519,1817 differentiates itself from other 18xx games with its sophisticated financial mechanics that simulate the laissez faire capitalism of early America.
1519,"While all the familiar mechanics of an 18xx game are present, such as placing tiles, purchasing tokens, and running trains, the game is won or lost based on the financial decisions you make."
1519,"1817 includes financial mechanics seen in other 18xx games such as mergers, friendly takeovers, and conversions to different share structures."
1519,"Beyond these basics, 1817 introduces several additional financial mechanics such as short selling, market driven interest rates, hostile takeovers, and corporate liquidations."
1519,The most unique is selling stock short.
1519,Short selling is the practice of selling stock you don’t own with the intention of buying the stock back at a later date.
1519,You hope to profit from a decline in the price of the stock between the sale and the repurchase.
1519,"Conversely, you will incur a loss if the price of the stock increases before the repurchase."
1519,You are also liable for dividends paid while holding the short position.

1524,"From GMT's website:
Volume VIII in GMT’s COIN Series transports us into the 4th and 5th Centuries A.D. and to the embattled Isle of Britannia."
1524,"Pendragon – The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic."
1524,"This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain."
1524,"Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives."
1524,"Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:
Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens."
1524,Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders.
1524,Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine—mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home.
1524,"Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ."

1524,Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands.
1524,"Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms."
1524,A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art.
1524,"Short, medium, and full-length scenarios
Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences."
1524,"Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:
The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace."
1524,"If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power."
1524,"You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but—as your peerless cavalry dwindles—you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati."
1524,"As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead."
1524,"If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals."
1524,"The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors."
1524,"When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope—materially or culturally—and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions."
1524,"The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain."
1524,"As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy."
1524,"You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons’ capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island—whoever their paymaster—the more opportunities for advancing your nation."
1524,"Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England."
1524,"The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways."
1524,"Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous..."
1524,"The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland."
1524,"As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home."
1524,"Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus… Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority."
1524,But beware that your very advances will help give rise and limit your ability to grapple new powerhouses on the island!

1527,The fight seems unfair as the seven of you might not seem to measure up to the dozens of enemies who want to slice you to pieces — but this comparison doesn't take into account your strong combat skills and an efficient team spirit that binds your samurai squad enough to face the threat.
1527,"Above all else, when everything seems desperate and lost, your enemies will discover that inside each of you lies a true beast, a warrior spirit ready to unleash its full power!"
1527,Samurai Spirit is a co-operative game in which each player is a fierce samurai defending a village surrounded by a horde of bandits.
1527,"The game plays out over three turns during which each player takes turns drawing bandit cards, then choosing whether they want to fight the bandit, defend the village, or let the bandit pass in order to help the other samurai."
1527,"The challenge of the game consists of balancing your choices: Should you fight each enemy to quickly reach your beast capacities, while also coming closer to the death and risking further loss by not defending the village sufficiently?"
1527,"Should you mainly defend or help the other samurai, taking the risk of remaining human too long and therefore weaker, when you know that weakness will be a major problem when facing the lieutenant and the villain bosses?"
1527,"Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village!"
1527,"Each turn ends with farms and fences being destroyed, and since those aren't unlimited, you must do what's necessary to end the game with at least one undamaged farm and enough farmers to tend it."
1527,Do you have what it takes to stand against evil and become a true hero?
1527,"Fight with courage, smartly assist your teammates, defend the poor villagers, turn into a savage beast, and wreak havoc on the enemy lines — all of this is up to you!"
1527,Ultimately it would be your honor to chose to die in a ultimate sacrifice in order to save the village.
1527,All of this is what makes the true samurai spirit!
1528,The world you know no longer exists.
1528,There is no government.
1528,No army.
1528,No civilization.
1528,The United States have collapsed.
1528,"And now, thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new State: the 51st State."
1528,"51st State is a card game in which players control one of the four powers (mutants, traders, New Yorkers and Appalachians) and try to build their very own new country."
1528,"Players put new locations into the game, they hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills."
1528,Every card in 51st State can be put into play in three different ways.
1528,"You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill."
1528,"One card, three possibilities."
1528,Lots of decisions and choices that matter.
1529,"Each player is a Gulo, or wolverine, trying to rescue a baby Gulo who got caught by the swamp vulture whose eggs it was trying to steal."
1529,"Unfortunately for the baby Gulo, all the adult Gulos are distracted by all the delicious swamp vulture eggs, and it has to wait very, very patiently as the adults constantly trip the very, very sensitive ""egg alarm"" rigged by the vulture to scare off the pesky Gulos."
1529,"There is a nice wooden bowl filled with multicolored swamp vulture eggs of various sizes, into which a long thin dowel with another egg at one end is inserted, like a flagpole."
1529,"As you can imagine, lots of M&M Peanut-shaped wooden bits banging around together in a polished wooden bowl makes it rather difficult to keep a thin dowel with weight at the top balanced..."
1529,"The essential mechanic of the game is to try to pull an egg of a particular color and move to a tile of that color on the linear path toward the bowl, and the little stack of tiles hiding the baby Gulo tile."
1529,"If you set off the alarm, or knock any eggs out of the bowl, your Gulo is sent back to the previous tile of the attempted color."
1529,"If there's no such tile, then back to the start he goes!"
1530,Command the world's best Special Forces operators and complete vital assault missions around the world!
1530,Warfighter is a card game for 1 to 6 players.
1530,You play cooperatively with your friends against the system to complete present day squad-level combat missions.
1530,"At the start of each mission, you each select a soldier, equip him/her with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit."
1530,"You then fight your way through hostile territory, engaging hostiles, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective."
1530,Every mission is a stand-alone game.
1530,"You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission."
1530,Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.
1530,"Warfighter uses a new combat system that takes into account the fire mode you select for your weapon, range, running out of ammo, suppression, and cover - all in the same dice roll!"
1530,This system creates an incredibly deep narrative with every attack.
1530,"As you eliminate hostiles, you gain experience to Upgun your Action cards."
1531,You've finally reached the Temple of Secrets with its immense treasure of gold — but what awaits you here?
1531,Fabulous wealth or total destruction?
1531,The proud and mysterious temple guards who are hiding amongst the adventurers are trying to lure them onto the wrong track in order to protect their gold.
1531,"Skillfully and with a deceitful tongue, they try to convince you to open the grave chambers behind which lies a dangerous fire trap."
1531,Can you trust anyone in the group when you don't know whether they're friend or foe?
1531,Tempel des Schreckens is a quick-playing bluffing game that reimplements the gameplay of TimeBomb in a new setting and for a larger group of players.
1532,"In SET, each card contains 1-3 objects, with all of the objects on a card having the same color, shape and shading, e.g., two purple shaded ovals."
1532,"Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined."
1532,All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck.
1532,A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute.
1532,"For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set."
1532,"To play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up."
1532,"The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so."
1532,"After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards."
1532,"(If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards."
1532,These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.)
1532,Whoever claims the most sets wins!
1533,Pergamon is a tactical collecting game with a theme based on excavating archaeological discoveries and managing their exhibition.
1533,"Set in the year 1878, the first excavations in what is now modern Turkey are uncovering the remains of ancient Pergamon."
1533,"Soon the precious discoveries will make their way abroad to public exhibitions before a waiting audience, eliciting substantial honor and glory."
1533,The players attempt to gain federal research grants to cover the costs of their excavations through a bidding mechanism.
1533,"Whoever is modest and less demanding can travel to the excavating areas before his or her competitors, and the rule is first come, first dig."
1533,Only fragments will remain for the later expeditions.
1533,"Recovered treasures are placed in valuable exhibitions, for which the discoverer receives glory and recognition."
1533,The player who accumulates the most glory after 12 rounds wins the game.
1533,The combination of soliciting funds and racing for the best locations to excavate makes Pergamon a variable game with rules that are easily accessible.
1533,Players are forced to make choices based on the money they can obtain and the sequence in which they choose where to dig.
1534,"From the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 to the beginning of WWI in 1914, there was an amazing development of bigger, faster, and more modern steamships."
1534,"Whereas in 1870 there are still many clippers around and the good old paddle steamer ""Scotia"" sails the North Atlantic, sea trade is dominated by the end of this era by huge vessels like ""Mauretania""(Cunard), ""Olympic""(White Star), or ""Imperator""(Hapag)."
1534,"In Transatlantic, 2 to 4 players lead their own shipping companies, which transport freight, mail, and passengers around the globe."
1534,"They purchase new steamships from the market, each of them historical with their individual technical data (tons, knots etc.)."
1534,"Competition is tough, especially in the North Atlantic where winning the ""Blue Riband"" is not only a matter of prestige, but may also be a profitable investment."
1534,"In order to let a shipping company flourish, purchasing the best steamships is not enough, if one fails to acquire enough coal bunkers and trade posts as well."
1534,"The game is driven by cards; on each turn, play one card and execute the related action."
1534,"As new cards enter the game, build your individual deck of cards with new or improved possibilities."
1534,The task is to manage your merchant fleet most efficiently.
1534,"It's a maritime strategy game with low luck, lots of interactive choices, and tough decisions."
1535,"Description from the publisher:
Will you play citizens into your hometown for points, or contribute them to the capital and benefit from their special abilities?"
1535,"In Capital Lux, you always balance on a razor's edge, so will you take risks?"
1535,Bluff?
1535,Or follow a carefully laid plan?
1535,"The choice is yours in this clever card game, featuring beautiful art by American painter Kwanchai Moriya."
1535,Each round begins with the players drafting a hand of five or six character cards.
1535,"On your turn, you must play a card either in front of you (your hometown) or in the middle of the table (the capital)."
1535,"When you play a card into the capital, you benefit from the card's special ability."
1535,"Each character belongs to one of four professions, and their special abilities are:

Merchant: Take 1 gold coin."
1535,Gold coins can be used at the end of a round to increase your own limit for one of the four professions.
1535,Agent: Draw a secret modifier card and add it (face down) to one of the four professions in the capital.
1535,This will affect the limit of the chosen profession at round's end.
1535,Scholar: Draw a card from the deck into your hand.
1535,"Cleric: Move the lowest valued card of any profession from the capital into your hometown

At the end of a round, for each profession, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your hometown than the current total value in the capital."
1535,"If you break the limit for one of the professions, you lose all cards of that profession from your hometown."
1535,"At the end of the third round, all characters remaining in a player's hometown are worth points."
1535,"This means that for every card there's a dilemma of whether to add it to your hometown for possible points, or to the capital which not only gives you the benefit from a special ability, but also increases the potential points for all players."
1535,"Since every player is dealt only five or six cards at the beginning of a round, every card play is crucial..."
1536,"During King's D. João V kingdom, Portugal was a major European power."
1536,"From Brazil, the king ordered Sergeant Melo Palheta to travel to the French Guyana to formally establish the Utrecht Treaty of 1713 and to secretly bring coffee seeds to Brazil."
1536,The Sergeant was successful and by 1800 Brazil was already one of the largest and biggest coffee producers in the world.
1536,"In the early XX century, coffee from Brazil, São Tomé and Príncipe, Angola and Timor is largely appreciated in Portugal and inspires the appearance of prestige coffee shops in emblematic locations that attract the elite."
1536,"Through dedication, hard work and competence, the Portuguese XX century witnesses the birth of one of the biggest coffee industries in the world."
1536,"In Café, 1 to 4 players represent coffee companies, that from plantation, aging, roasting and distribution, try to create and control the best supply chain of coffee."

1537,"In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes."
1537,It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter!
1537,"The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game."
1537,Each player is dealt a hand of cards.
1537,In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards.
1537,"Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards."
1537,"If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem."
1537,The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.
1537,"To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error."
1537,"Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty."
1537,"Jungle Jam, Медвед, and Prawo Dżungli are unauthorized reproductions of Jungle Speed/Arriba!"

1540,"In an ancient world forgotten by time, enormous titans terrorize the land."
1540,"Five tribes have been fleeing from the titans for centuries, but things are about to change."
1540,"Growing city-states pledge to end the reign of terror, determined to take on the titans and make the world a safer place for all."
1540,"Each city-state competes to attract the tribes, eager for the strength of the combined peoples, who are now leaving behind old traditions with the hope that the titans can be defeated once and for all."
1540,"In The Ancient World, players compete to grow the largest and most influential city-state by managing citizens, treasury, and military and by defeating titans."
1540,Players take turns sending citizens to take special actions or using military cards to attack titans.
1540,"One of the actions a citizen can perform is to build Empire cards, which give more citizens, money, and abilities."
1540,A city-state's influence in the world is measured by sets of tribe banners that it owns.
1540,"Each Empire card has one or more tribe banners, and tribe banners can also be gained by defeating titans."
1540,Players gain victory points (VPs) for sets of tribe banners.
1540,"After six rounds, the player with the most VPs from sets of tribe banners wins."

1541,Canopy is a game in which two players compete to grow the most bountiful rainforest.
1541,"The jungle ecosystem is full of symbiosis and mutualism, and players must grow tall trees and lush jungle plants to attract the most diverse wildlife."
1541,"By carefully selecting what grows in your forest, you can create the ideal balance of flora and fauna and develop a thriving rainforest."
1541,"In the game, players take turns selecting new cards for their forest from three growth piles."
1541,"Each time you look at a pile, you may select it and add those cards to your rainforest tableau, or return the pile face down, adding one additional card to it."
1541,"As the piles grow, you must search for the plants and animals that will benefit your forest the most — but choose carefully as the jungle also contains dangers in the form or fire, disease, and drought."
1541,—description from the publisher
1542,"In Habitats, each player builds a big wildlife park without cages or fences."
1542,"The animals in your park need their natural habitats: grassland, bush, rocks or lakes."
1542,"The zebra needs a big area of grass and some water adjacent, for example, while a bat needs rocks and bush and water, a hart needs bush and grass, and a crocodile needs mainly water."
1542,"There is a snake, baboon, bee, elephant, otter, lizard, turtle, eagle, meerkat, scorpio, hog, catfish, rhino, etc., each with its own landscape requirements — 68 different animals in total."
1542,"Each player starts their individual park with an entrance tile, and they are each represented in the marketplace of animal tiles by a ceramic figure (or a wooden ranger meeple in some editions)."
1542,"On a turn, a player takes the tile to their left, right or front; moves their figure to the space just vacated; then draws a tile to place where their figure started the turn."
1542,"When adding an animal tile in your park, you add its main landscape — the base space for the animal — to your park, too."
1542,"While placing this new animal, its own piece of landscape can help to fulfill the requirements of your other animals' requirements, e.g., the water on a hippo tile fulfilling the adjacent otter's need for water."
1542,"Thus, fulfilling every animal's desire for land becomes a more and more difficult task with each tile you add."
1542,"Aside from expanding your park with different landscape types, flora and animals, you can improve its profitability by building extra entrance roads, trek spots, and watchtowers."
1542,"Habitats lasts three seasons, with each season giving each player 6-9 new tiles for their parks."
1542,"Whoever has best met the goal of the season receives bonus points, with a smaller number of points for second and third place."
1542,"At the end of the game, each player scores for each tile in their park based on whether that tile's requirements are satisfied."
1542,Whoever scores the most points wins!

There are three different adventure scenarios to choose from, depending on the age/skill of the players: 

Adventure 1 (The Fellowship ) the simplest of the three adventures
Adventure 2 (The Magnificent) a little more challenging
Adventure 3 (Escape to the Cities) the most challenging because there are many things to pay attention to simultaneously"
1544,"Bios:Megafauna starts where the predecessor game Bios:Genesis left off, with the invasion of the land on the daybreak of the Phanerozoic eon."
1544,"Starting as either a plant, mollusk, insect, or vertebral skeletal type, your flapping, paddling, and squawking carnivores and herbivores make a beachhead on one of the drifting continental plates in the Cambrian, Their struggle for terrestrial dominance may eventually include language-based consciousness."
1544,"Although this achievement elevated a certain mammal species to notoriety, in your game things may occur differently."
1544,This second edition of Bios:Megafauna is an evolutionary descendant of American Megafauna but as a part of the Bios series of games it is linked to the game Bios:Genesis.
1544,It plays well independently but if you have both games you can let the end state of a game of Bios:Genesis affect the starting state of a game of Bios:Megafauna.
1544,"A successor game, called Bios:Origins (which would be a descendant of Origin), is planned to cover the events of the Quaternary period including the rise of ideas and technology."

 The Diplomatic phase where players negotiate deals, forge alliances etc."

1546,The Naval phase each player conducts naval moves in sequence.

1546,"As status always gravitates to a central position players must continually ""politik"" to reach their goal."
1547,Mordheim does to Warhammer Fantasy what Necromunda does to Warhammer 40k.
1547,The game mechanics work in classic Games Workshop fashion.
1547,"Instead of playing with hundreds of miniatures, you pick a warband of 1-20 models (most average at 10-12 or so), and fight a skirmish with other warbands."
1547,"If you play well, your warband gains money, levels, size, and new powers, but play badly and your warband slowly deteriorates as people die or otherwise get dismembered."
1547,"Games actually play very similar to Necromunda but due to the fantasy setting you should see fewer long distance shots, and a lot more hand to hand fighting."
1548,"Explore places, combine items, and experience stories in Adventure Games, a series of co-operative games from German publisher KOSMOS."
1548,"In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play."
1548,"Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story."
1548,"Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!"
1548,"Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure."
1548,"That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered."
1548,"Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play."
1548,"Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times."
1548,"In The Dungeon, the players awaken in a prison cell in the middle ages with no memory of how they got there."
1548,What happened?
1548,What strange things are taking place in this dungeon?
1548,"And most importantly, how can they get out?"
1548,"Over three chapters, players will jointly explore rooms, combine objects, and perhaps even encounter creatures that lurk in the dark rooms of the old castle..."
1549,Siam 1874: A power struggle has broken out.
1549,"Siam's king has initiated reforms that have resulted in a clash between the Malays, Lao, and Royalists."
1549,"The appearance of unity, however, must be preserved or the British might move in and make a colony out of Siam."
1549,Will the Siamese succeed in this tightrope walk and maintain the nation of freedom?
1549,"In King of Siam, the players use action cards both to compete for influence on the contending factions and to tip the power struggle in favor of the faction where their own influence is the greatest – but the players must be careful."
1549,Too much conflict will result in a British intervention and new victory conditions are immediately resolved.
1549,After the initial setup King of Siam has no random elements and no luck.
1549,The game is playable by 2-3 players individually or four players in partnerships.
1550,Sanctum is a competitive strategy game inspired by hack-and-slash RPG video games.
1550,"Each player controls one of four unique characters as they journey into the heart of the fallen city of Sanctum, building up their skills and arsenals along the way to prepare for the final fight against the Demon Lord."
1550,"Multiple players may survive the fight, but only one may claim the glory of purifying Sanctum."
1550,"Gameplay is brisk, with the possibility for overlapping turns."
1550,"The four characters all have unique skill sets, and you’ll level up fast, giving you frequent opportunities to choose new skills."
1550,Every decision counts.
1550,"Though the game is competitive, the goal is to destroy the Demon Lord, not each other."
1550,So player interaction is a race rather than a fight: Who’s furthest along the board?
1550,Who will get to choose first when an equipment draft gets triggered?
1550,Who will gain the benefit of reaching the Demon Lord first?
1550,Who will get to that group of blue demons everyone wants?
1550,Who will unlock that achievement and claim the bonus?
1550,"On your turn, you choose one action:
1) Move: Advance along the path toward the Demon Lord, and engage some demon minions to fight later."
1550,2) Fight: Fight all the demon minions you’ve engaged.
1550,"If you kill any demons, upgrade Skills and acquire Items."
1550,"3) Rest: Equip some of the loot you’ve won, recharge the resources you use to fight, and buy potions with extra Items you don't need."
1550,"The choices you’ll be balancing and weighing against each other as you go include:
- What demons should you fight?"
1550,"Demons come in three colors: Blue, red, and green."
1550,The color of the demon determines which of your character’s Skills you’ll be able to choose to upgrade if you win the fight.
1550,"Plus, each Demon drops a specific piece of gear when you beat it."
1550,What kind of gear do you need — a chest plate?
1550,Footgear?
1550,A weapon?
1550,"Finally, since killing demons requires you to roll dice to match the die face showing on the demon’s card, which demons can you kill based on your current gear and skill setup?"
1550,- Which Skills should you unlock?
1550,Each character has 9 skills.
1550,Which ones you choose to gain in a given game drastically changes how the character functions.
1550,- What gear should you equip?
1550,Some gear helps you block damage.
1550,Some helps you modify dice rolls.
1550,"The better the gear, the harder it is to equip."
1550,"- When should you Move, Fight, and Rest?"
1550,"You’ll want to Move and Fight as many times as possible between Rests, but wait too long to Rest and you may take more damage than you can afford."
1550,"Rest too often, though, and you’ll fall behind the other players and miss out on some kills."
1550,"- Should you do what is most optimal for your character at any given moment, or should you sometimes put that aside in order to claim competitive achievements before other players can?"
1550,The final battle with the Demon Lord is tough.
1550,Even surviving can feel rewarding.
1550,But only the player with the most health at the end of the boss fight can truly claim the glory of his defeat!
1551,The Rifts changed our world.
1551,"Villages were torn apart, Riftforce emerged from it and spread across the land."
1551,What seemed lifeless before started to rise and wake.
1551,Flames left campfires and waves poured out of their riverbeds.
1551,Even the sun and moon leave their footprints in the ground.
1551,We learned how to control those living elementals and formed guilds to perfect this knowledge.
1551,While competing for Riftforce the guilds forged temporary alliances to share their unique abilities and guard the access to the Rifts.
1551,Now it is your time!
1551,"Choose your guilds, combine their powers and rush into battle."
1551,Gain Riftforce from the land you control and all the elementals you destroy until you have enough to ascend into a higher state of power.
1551,"•••
In Riftforce, the two-player duel card game, each player starts by drafting four of the ten different guilds, each with a unique power, to forge their own asymmetrical alliance."
1551,Every game of Riftforce gives you a chance to discover new synergies between guilds which will greatly influence your overall strategy and strengths.
1551,Can you combine the flexible and mobile water guild with the all-consuming fire elementals who even harm their allies and unleash their full potential?
1551,The guilds’ elementals are the lifeblood of the game - they are your troops and at the same time the resource necessary to attack.
1551,Soon you will find yourself wondering how to use them best.
1551,"Each turn you are torn, choosing one of three possible actions."
1551,"Do you want to strengthen your position at the Rift, sacrifice elementals for powerful combo attacks or gather support for your next turn?"
1551,Gain Riftforce by destroying the elements of your opponent and by controlling locations along the Rift.
1551,Only then will you ascend and win the game.
1551,"Discovering new synergies between the different guilds, clever gameplay combos and the deeper layers of strategy will keep you coming back to enjoy the game again and again."
1552,"Set in the Roman stadium Circus Maximus, players use cards to move their chariots around a quasi-variable track."
1552,"The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500)."
1552,"Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop)."
1552,"The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race."
1552,"Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck."
1552,The new Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.
1553,"Theme:
Florence, fifteenth century."
1553,The inventors of the Renaissance created amazing machines for the Lord of the city.
1553,Become the protagonist of this age of unbelievable discoveries by realizing your inventions!
1553,"You'll direct your team into the laboratories, workshops, among the shops and perhaps learn the intrigues of the palace."
1553,Only the best can rival the great Leonardo!
1553,"Summary:
A worker-placement game for 2-5 players with an interesting bidding mechanic."
1553,"In many other worker-placement games, if an opponent beats you to a spot, you're out of luck."
1553,Not so in Leonardo de Vinci.
1553,"Here, you can bid more workers to jump ahead in line."
1553,"And people at the back of the line, can still get something, but they have to pay more to get it."
1553,The competition for resources is very dynamic and fun.
1553,"Your same workers that compete for resources may also power your laboratory, so you must balance acquiring resources with working in the laboratory so that you can complete inventions and not run out of Florins (i.e."
1553,manage cash-flow).
1553,The key is planning your resources and production capacity to maximize the number of inventions you can make and therefore maximize the amount of Florins you can earn.
1553,The last two rounds of the game require extra careful planning because new resources cannot be acquired.

1554,"Robots efficiently upgrade and adjust your abilities, leveraging unique goals to maximize points."
1554,"By the end of the game, the game board has morphed into a modern subway map, with brightly-colored routes connecting stations all over the city."
1554,Maglev Metro contains two unique maps.

1555,"In The Great Heartland Hauling Co. (originally announced as Over the Road), players take on the role of medium haul Midwest truck drivers doing their best to make a living by hauling goods for big suppliers."
1555,"Players truck to various locations around America's Heartland, picking up and dropping off goods using matching cards from their hands."
1555,Most locations have native goods that require fewer cards to load; other locations may pay a premium for those goods but may also require more fuel – and time – to get there with the cargo.
1555,"With limited space in each trailer and only five cards in hand at a time, players will have to expertly manage their resources, as well as play the odds and press their luck to be the best trucker on the road."
1555,The Great Heartland Hauling Co. offers a lot of replay value through the use of cards to create a variable board set-up each game.
1555,"The game includes 60 goods cubes, four thick cardboard trucks, and 46 resource cards – required for pick-up and delivery – that are drawn from a shared draft board, as well as 20 fuel cards, which are used to move about the Heartland."
1556,"Adventure Time Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players based on the original Love Letter game by Seiji Kanai, except re-themed with characters of the hit cartoon Adventure Time."
1556,Players are suitors trying to gain the affections of Princess Bubblegum (#8).
1556,"In a round, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play."
1556,"On a turn, you draw one card, and discard one of the two, using the power of the discarded card to try to eliminate other players from the round."
1556,"If you're the last player in the round, or the player with the highest card when the deck runs out, then you score a point."
1556,The game is played until a player reaches a certain amount of points determined by the numbers of players.
1556,"The card art is styled to be Adventure Time characters ""cosplaying"" the characters from the Tempest version of Love Letter by AEG."
1556,There are two differences in this version.
1556,Number 1 is a new win condition.
1556,"If a player plays a ""Hero"" (#5), either Finn or Jake, and makes another player (including themselves) discard the other ""Hero"" card, they win the round."
1556,The idea is that you are reuniting the iconic best buds.
1556,"Number 2 is, if you manage to win the round with a ""companion"" in your hand, you win 2 tokens instead of only one."
1557,"Human Punishment is a combination of social deduction, social experiment, and party game for 4-16 players."
1557,"Each player takes on the role of a human, a machine, or an outlaw in a distant future."
1557,"Players must investigate others to figure out who is on their side, grab one of the four different weapons, and eliminate the enemies."
1557,Stay focused because hidden enemies may be on your team!
1557,"Find your team, trust no one!"
1557,The traitor mechanism in Human Punishment transforms the table into a social experiment...
1558,"In Mangrovia, a light ""gamer's game""/family game with a Caribbean mangrove setting, a clever role selection mechanism allows the players to choose two different bonuses/actions as well as the turn order in which they want these actions to be carried out — all by placing just one marker."
1558,"Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability."
1558,The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape.
1558,"If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game."
1558,You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods.
1558,"Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces."
1558,"Building a hut requires that the space's landscape is ""active"" and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space."
1558,"Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start."
1558,"The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial."
1558,"In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called ""ritual sites""."
1558,"A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action."
1558,"If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa)."
1558,"A fourth action type is to select ""active landscapes"" and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round."
1558,"After all players have performed two actions, the round ends."
1558,The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.
1558,Collecting amulets may be key in this game.
1558,"Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards — and still to the exact price."
1558,Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths.
1558,In order to gain enough amulets — and amulets of the appropriate values — you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces.
1558,"The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw."
1558,The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.
1558,"The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one."
1558,"The spaces that are part of two divine paths are obviously most tempting, but can you afford to build your huts there?"
1559,Players are mad scientists in need of precious mortals for future experiments.
1559,"Rather than getting your hands dirty, your army of campy creatures awaits to do your bidding."
1559,Capture the most valuable mortals over the course of three nights to win.
1559,But be warned — the mortals won't go down without a fight.
1559,"Campy Creatures is a ghoulish game of bluffing, deduction, and set collection for 2-5 players."
1559,Players begin each round with the same hand of creatures.
1559,Their goal is to capture valuable mortals by outguessing their opponents with the creatures they play.
1559,"Each player has perfect information at the start, so knowing what a person might do in a particular situation is key."
1560,"The great river Key Flow passes through the new Key Lands, carrying ships laden with resources for building and trade."
1560,"Along the riverside, buildings are built, boats are moored in docks, and animals graze in the fields."
1560,"Players build communities alongside this river, and send workers (known as ""keyples"") to work in both their own and their neighbors' businesses, enabling their economy to develop and flourish."
1560,Key Flow is a card-driven game based on many of the ideas contained in the award-winning game Keyflower.
1560,"The game flows quickly over four game rounds (seasons), allowing players to develop their own unique village, with many ways to score points for their buildings, animals, keyples, resources and other items."
1560,Key Flow is played over four seasons (rounds).
1560,"Each season, players are dealt a number of cards."
1560,They then choose one of their cards and pass the remaining cards to the player on their left or right — depending on the season — until all the cards have been chosen.
1560,All scoring takes place at the end of winter.
1560,"Points are scored from the village cards in various ways, through upgrading buildings, and from gathering gold."
1560,The player who scores the most points wins.

1564,"Ascension: Rise of Vigil is a deck-building game in which players acquire cards from a central pool, then place those cards in their discard pile to be shuffled into their deck for later use; creatures also show up in that shared card pool, and players can combat them to earn victory points (VPs) and possibly other benefits, such as the ability to remove less useful cards from their deck or to banish cards from the pool that others might find useful."

1564,"(Non-treasure cards can also provide energy, but they are usually worth VPs whereas treasure is worthless aside from the energy.)"

1579,Five Titans that make the cosmos breath.

1579,Iwari is an abstract-like Eurogame in which players represent different tribes looking for their identity by traveling around far lands and expanding their settlements into five different regions on the board.
1579,"In the game, players use cards for two different actions:
1) Place tents and expand their settlements into five different regions on the board in a majority game that scores on each territory."
1579,2) Construct nature totems to bond with the Titans by placing them on regions and score points based on the totem majorities in adjacent territories.
1579,"During the game, players can complete missions that grant small perks and score points by having the majority of tents in each territory after the end of the first card cycle."

1580,"Game description from the publisher:
You've just been given a shot at being the head chef at the prestigious New York Slice pizza parlor."
1580,Now you and your fellow pizza chef wannabes have to make the most amazing pizzas...one slice at a time!
1580,"In New York Slice, each player slices pizzas into portions, giving their opponents first choice, while they take the leftovers."
1580,"There are a dozen kinds of pizza to work with, from veggie to hawaiian to meat lover's, and each player decides if they want to eat or keep some of the slices, building the best collection of pizzas possible!"
1580,"Each time a player slices a pizza, there's a different special to go along with it, whether it's allocated to one of the portions or placed on its own."
1580,"Specials provide the player with special powers or points, such as calling dibs on a slice before the pizza is divided, getting one of the normally-out-of-the-game ""mystery slices', having an opportunity to ""sneak a slice"" by moving it from one portion to another when they choose, and many more—there are 14 different ""Today's Specials"" in the game."
1580,Some slices have anchovies on them (yuck!
1580,"), which are worth negative points to anyone who collects them — but anchovies might show up on different pizza types you're collecting, so in order to have the majority of a type, you just might have to collect one with anchovies on it!"
1580,"If you tie another player for the most slices of a type, neither of you gets any points — but a bunch of slices have two types of pizza on them, with each combo slice being worth half a slice of each type, which is great for breaking ties."
1580,"Most slices have pepperoni on them, which you can eat for points (instead of collecting to go for the majority of each slice type)."
1581,"In Forge War, players will take on the role of blacksmiths in a kingdom rife with marauding harpies, cursed dungeons and fire-breathing dragons."
1581,"They are charged with gathering ore from the mines, purchasing weapon designs from the market and then using these resources to forge weapons for adventurers who will go on quests to fight back the ever-deepening darkness."
1581,"If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire."
1581,"At its core, Forge War is a rewarding game of aggressive investment, which occurs through the acquisition of quests."
1581,"Quest management becomes challenging for the player, however, because quests undertaken aren't completed immediately, but instead progress each turn and become more difficult."
1581,"At specific time intervals, players will need to add more resources to their quests or face failure."
1581,Gameplay cycles through three different phases in each round.
1581,The first phase consists of moving pieces around a hex grid to maximize resource production.
1581,The second phase is a market phase that features an action blocking mechanic to gain access to new weapon plans and other advantages.
1581,"The final phase is the acquisition and management of quests, which are selected from a pool of available cards."
1582,"As the first winner of the Spiel des Jahres award in 1979, Hare and Tortoise or the German Hase und Igel (for Hare and Hedgehog) will always be regarded as a classic game."
1582,It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.
1582,You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.
1582,"The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track."
1582,It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.
1582,There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare & Tortoise by different publishers.
1582,"Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square."
1582,"Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that ""... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn."
1582,"This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable."
1582,"This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all...""


  Tournament Jugging the Hare rule -- When you land on a hare square do nothing immediately."
1582,"If nobody goes past you, draw 10 carrots when you next move."
1582,"If they do, pay 10 carrots into the carrot patch for each player who goes past you, in either direction."

1584,"The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves."
1584,"The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge."
1584,"You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you."
1584,"If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead."
1584,"Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever."
1584,"A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks."
1584,"Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple."

1642,"In addition to the one extra card, LL: The Hobbit differs from the original game in that the Baron (#3) is represented by two separate cards: Tauriel and Legolas."
1642,"When you use an elf's power to compare cards, Tauriel knocks out the player with the higher valued card while Legolas targets the lower valued card."
1642,"(This change isn't in the German edition, where Legolas and Tauriel have the same text.)"
1642,"Whoever first wins 4-7 rounds, with the number dependent on the number of players, wins the game!"
1643,Time's Up!
1643,Blue is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two).
1643,"Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them."
1643,"Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds."
1643,"In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds."
1643,"In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card."
1643,"In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer."
1643,"In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess."
1643,"Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!"
1644,"A new castle is being built for the king, and lots of workers are coming from far away to make their contribution."
1644,"Each player is a master builder, who will have to make a tactical choice from a number of character cards each turn."
1644,"But watch out, the character cards also cause interaction, making for a surprising and varied game."
1644,"Only when the points are counted at the end of the game, the victor will be known!"
1644,Players use cards from their hands to take actions.
1644,These are revealed simultaneously and then resolved in a set order.
1644,"One of the cards allows a player to pick the cards back up into their hand, allowing them to reuse cards previously played."
1644,"Players collect resources and money, and build buildings."
1644,"Once a building is built, the tile is moved to reveal spaces for workers."
1644,These spaces give bonus points at the end of the game.
1644,The person with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.
1645,"The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie's Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail — that is, keep on the game board — as long as possible."
1645,Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.
1645,"Each turn players add ""wake"" tiles to the 7×7 game board; each tile has two ""wake connections"" on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths."
1645,"If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake."
1645,"If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game."
1645,"What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep."
1645,"Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation."
1645,"On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place."
1645,"To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die."
1645,"On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow."
1645,"On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board."
1645,"If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game."
1645,Another way to be ousted!
1645,"The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water..."
1646,"Growing tomatoes, lettuce, or carrots on Iceland?"
1646,What an absurd idea!
1646,"But still, whoever had that idea was a genius!"
1646,Geothermal energy on the island allows you to cultivate the most unexpected fruits and vegetables — an oddity that no tourist would want to miss.
1646,"You are not the only farmer in Reykholt who is looking to make a fortune out of this, however, so you better be quick!"
1646,"The tourist season in Reykholt is short, and there are more people coming every year."
1646,Making use of the right people and having the right vegetables at the right time in Reykholt will give you the advantage you need to win the race!
1647,"""Breakout: Normandy"" is a complex two-player wargame on the Allied invasion of France in World War 2."

1647,"The German player tries to prevent a successful Allied landing, and if that fails, to contain the beachhead."
1647,"The Allied player wins by establishing a beachhead, or (better) by successfully breaking out of the landing area."
1647,The mapboard depicts the Normandy area where the initial landings took place.
1647,"Units are regiments and brigades, representing infantry, airborne, armour artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft units."
1647,"The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Turning Point: Stalingrad."
1648,"Each morning, Odin sends the ravens Hugin and Munin to race over the world of Midgard and report back what they have seen."
1648,"The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store, and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth."
1648,"In this two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks comprising domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land."
1648,"Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path."
1648,"Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven."
1648,"In this first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future."
1648,"The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens."
1648,There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.
1648,"In addition, whoever has played more cards to the ""Magic Way"" during the round – a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card – wins three points."
1648,"Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins."
1648,"The Odin's Ravens (Second Edition) transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Loki deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire."
1648,Whoever reaches the end of the world first wins.
1649,"Once an age, a mythic wind lifts the veil between the spirit world and ours."
1649,"Whimsical seraphs, drawn to the vigor of an ancient forest, descend through clouds to once again take up their centennial game."
1649,You are one of these seraphs – a being of great power and curiosity.
1649,"The life of the forest fascinates you, and you eagerly gather plant, animal, and sprite alike to add to your mystical menagerie."
1649,"But beware, for you are not alone."
1649,Other beings just like yourself contest to collect the life of the forest as well!
1649,"In Spirits of the Forest, players represent the four elements that nourish the forces of nature."
1649,"Up to four players compete to acquire the most (of nine different) spirit symbols, which are bound to a different element of nature."
1649,"Each turn, a player drafts up to two spirit tiles from the forest (a common pool of 48 spirit tiles), collects favor tokens, and moves, places, or recovers gemstones."
1649,Players continue taking turns until all tiles have been collected from the forest.
1649,"At the end of the game, players score nature points for each spirit (augmented by favor tokens) of which they have a majority."
1649,Whoever has the most nature points at the end of the game wins.

1650,"Aided by superb defensive tactics and the timely arrival of Prussian reinforcements, Wellington defeated the French in the great Battle of Waterloo, ending forever the military ambitions of the great Napoleon."
1650,"Highlights:

 Mapboard which is a color map of southern Belgium."
1650,"Wooden Blocks as counters provide step-reduction and fog of war with no muss or fuss 


 Two or three player game - Napoleon can be played by two or three players."
1650,"With three, the allied side has two players, one British and one Prussian, and some special rules apply."
1650,Note that there are essentially three different versions of the game which means that the rules are somewhat different.
1650,"Key Differences in the various editions:
 1st and 2nd edition had 48 blocks--shorter (60+ min.)"
1650,"play time -- vs.-- 3rd edition has 84 blocks--more accurate division level
  3rd edition had Blücher, Napoleon, and Wellington leader blocks that give slight combat and movement bonuses."
1650,"Although units have increased nearly two fold, the 3rd edition map remains same size, leading to overcrowding."
1650,4th edition has 56 blocks and a larger map - play time is usually 90 minutes or less.
1651,Wage war against opponents on a hexagonal board.
1651,Prepare your armies to face off on the battlefield and surprise your enemy with your choice of special abilities!
1651,"Monolith Arena is a fantasy battleground board game built around the base engine of Neuroshima Hex, which is also from designer Michał Oracz."
1651,"The game includes four factions, with unique abilities and units."
1651,"Players take turns placing tiles on the hexagonal play field, building offensive and defensive advantages, all of which are activated when the field is filled or when a player uses a ""battle"" order."
1651,"A new feature is the three-level ""monolith"" for each player, where the faction banner is set into the top level."
1651,"The other two levels are secretly set with battlefield tokens chosen by the player at the outset, providing a strategic choice in setup that will play out during the tactical operations of the game."
1651,"The monoliths mitigate the influence of the random tile draw that otherwise drives the game, giving players more choice and control."
1652,Go back in time to the prehistoric era of Kingdomino!
1652,"Kingdomino Origins plays similarly to the original game, but introduces new components for additional actions and new ways to score points."
1652,Regions in your territory will earn you points if they contain fire.
1652,Fire is either part of your terrains or earned by adding dominoes with volcanoes.
1652,"There are three game modes to play:

The first one introduces fire and volcanoes;
The second mode uses wooden resources;
And the third one features cavemen tokens."
1652,"You earn points by collecting resources, with additional points when you have the majority of a type of resources."
1652,"These resources allow you to bring cavemen to your territory, and each type of caveman has its own way to give you points based on their position."

1653,"In 1845, Sir John Franklin led an expedition on behalf of the British Royal Navy to find and explore the last portion of the Northwest Passage, regardless of the cost."
1653,"The Royal Navy gave Franklin two heavy Ships (HMS Terror and HMS Erebus) filled with scientific equipment, 1000 books, a crew of 128 men, and enough food to last for three years."
1653,They left England in May and encountered whalers along the west coast of Greenland in August.
1653,"There, they waited for more favorable weather conditions for the crossing of the Lancaster Sound."
1653,"Once the weather improved, they sailed into unknown waters, and no one ever heard from them again...
Their disappearance provoked a great deal of turmoil in public opinion, and numerous British and American expeditions attempted to find their trail."
1653,"As leaders of these expeditions in Expedition: Northwest Passage, players must venture into these hazardous Arctic waters in order to discover Franklin's fate and succeed where he failed – by finding the Northwest Passage."
1653,"Players allocate their crewmen in their ship or in their sled to perform various actions such as exploring, moving, or gathering clues on the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition."
1653,"As the game progresses, the seasons will pass and parts of the sea will be frozen, blocking the way for the ships."
1653,"Players acquire victory points by gathering clues, mapping the area, and – of course – discovering the Northwest Passage."
1653,"However, in order to claim victory, one has to come back home to the Greenland on time!"
1654,"Ra - The Dice Game takes all the major thematic elements of ""Ra"" and uses them very creatively in a dice game."
1654,"Pharaohs, The Nile, Civilizations, and Monuments as well as the occasional catastrophe are all here."
1654,"Instead of auctions, the core mechanism of Ra, each player rolls 5 dice and can reroll any of them up to two times."
1654,"The five dice have identical sides, but different colors - the die color matters in some occasions (eg."
1654,a player can't claim purple civilization square with a green die).
1654,"Then, according to the roll, the player claims some squares on the central board (civilizations, monuments, Niles etc.)"
1654,"or moves the Ra figure, which determines the remaining time in Epoch."
1654,"One die side is a joker and can be used as any other side, as long as one of the other dice actually shows the mentioned other side."
1654,Players need to consider how to utilize their roll for the best personal gain.
1654,"Scoring takes place in three Epochs (with monuments only scored after the third) and is nearly identical as in the original Ra, but this time the score is kept on a score track on the edge of the board, instead of tokens."
1654,From the box: Remember Ra!
1654,Now Reiner has added dice to the game and in such a great way.
1654,"Players still try to score by collecting Pharaohs, niles and floods, monuments and civilizations, but this time they roll dice and choose which to keep and which to re-roll."
1654,"True to the original game, players must watch out for disasters and each of the three rounds ends when ""Ra"" shows up a set number of times, so players need to watch Ra and decide when the round may end and when they have more time."
1654,"After three rounds, the player with the most points is the winner!"
1655,Machi Koro Legacy features the same gameplay as Machi Koro.
1655,"You are still rolling dice, you are still collecting income, and you are still racing to build landmarks — but then you unlock the [censored] and you start earning a little extra income by [censored], and then you start to explore the [censored] and you have to make a choice between [censored] and [censored]."
1655,"Even if you aren't in contention to win a given game, you still have [censored] to set up exciting [censored] for the next one."
1655,"And then the [paragraph deleted]...
Machi Koro Legacy features a ten-game series that tells a complete story set in the world of Machi Koro in which player choices create a unique gameplay experience."

1656,"Theme:
Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world."
1656,"Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc."
1656,"The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command."
1656,"Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top."
1656,"Goal:
Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world."
1656,"Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions."
1656,"They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other."
1656,"Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command."
1656,Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.
1656,"Gameplay:
To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided."
1656,Characters have basic statistics to start.
1656,"These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence]."
1656,"Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two."
1656,"Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells."
1656,This all makes the players actually feel different during play.
1656,"In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc."
1656,"Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices."
1656,On a player's turn they throw a die for movement.
1656,"Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world."
1656,"Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space."
1656,Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter.
1656,"These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics."
1656,Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions.
1656,"If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so."
1656,The defender defends with same statistic attacked with.
1656,"If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice."
1656,"If the attacker loses, he loses a life."
1656,"Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world."
1656,"There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price."
1656,"Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple."
1656,"However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card."
1656,"In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman."
1656,The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.
1656,"Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World."
1656,"There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command."
1656,"Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life."
1656,It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.
1656,"Revised using:

Talisman: Upgrade Pack"
1657,"Carrom is most easily described as ""finger pool""."
1657,"On a 29"" x 29"" wooden board, players flick a large weighted disc (the striker) at smaller wooden discs (the carrom-men)."
1657,"The goal is to sink your 9 carrom-men (black or white), as well as the red Queen, in the four corner pockets."
1657,"The first player or team to accomplish this collects points for the round (commonly called a ""board"")."
1657,A standard game of Carrom continues until one player has 25 points or 8 boards have been completed.
1657,"Carrom is typically played with powder, and some variations of the game use cues."
1657,"The most widely played form of 'proper' Carrom is supported by a world wide set of rules known as The Laws of Carrom, and are available from the International Carrom Federation."
1657,"Carrom bears similarities to Pool and Crokinole, but is a fascinating game in its own right with varied strategies and techniques."
1657,No one knows exactly where the game originated.
1657,"It could have come from Bangladesh, Burma, Egypt, or Ethiopia, but most believe it originated in India."
1657,"Also see American Carrom and the European games in a similar vein, Korona and H-ring spel."
1658,"The Realms lay divided, their former wonder lost and forgotten."
1658,"The Tyrant Queen has seized the throne, forcing the rightful heirs deep into exile."
1658,"You are the sons and daughters of the once-great houses: Foxway, Gorga, Mherzeen, and Spyre."
1658,"Under the tutelage of advisors, you have gathered your followers, your conscripts."
1658,The time has come to take back what is yours.
1658,"Path of Light and Shadow is a massive empire-building experience, combining area control, deck management, and civilization customization."
1658,"As players vie for control of The Realms, they must enlist and promote supporters, outfit their burgeoning empire with powerful technologies, align with powerful leaders, and lay siege to rival exiles after the throne."
1658,"Above all else, each player must decide what type of leader they will become, cruel or merciful."
1658,"But choose wisely, for each path has its rewards and perils."
1659,"A collectible card game, set in a fantasy empire called Rokugan, based loosely upon medieval Japan and Japanese Mythology."
1659,"The factions available have changed over the editions, but generally include the 7 Great Clans: Crab, Crane, Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, Scorpion, and Unicorn."
1659,"Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games."
1659,"The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold."
1659,The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.
1659,Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.
1659,"The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game."
1659,"When you say ""I'm a Crab player"" you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player."
1659,"When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit."
1659,L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced.
1659,These are still a core part of the game.
1659,"The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: 

 Clan War, a miniatures game."
1659,"Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game."
1659,"Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan."
1659,"Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game

As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments."
1659,Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.
1659,"In 2008, L5R held the first ""Mega-Game"" which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc."
1659,"), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more."
1659,"The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan."
1659,"In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG."
1659,"Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history."
1659,"In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game."
1659,2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.
1659,"2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks."
1659,"In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design."
1659,"The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017."
1659,FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).
1660,Each player controls colored mice and tries to collect pieces of cheese in Castle Appenzell.
1660,"On their turn, players spend action points to put new mice into play, reveal corridors in the castle, move their mice around the castle, or push a tile into play, which changes the maze of cheese pieces underneath."
1660,"If two of a single player's mice reach a place with the same kind of cheese showing, the player obtains a piece of this cheese."
1660,The first player with 4 different pieces of cheese wins the game.
1661,"In Edo, players represent daimyo in mid-second millennium Japan who are trying to serve their shogun by using their samurai to construct castles, markets and houses in Tokyo and surrounding areas."
1661,"At the start of Edo – which won ""best evening-length game"" in the 2010 Hippodice Game Design competition under the name Altiplano – each player has five samurai tokens, seven houses, one market and three square action cards, each of which has four possible actions on it."
1661,"One card, for example, allows a player to:

Collect rice (up to four bundles depending on the number of samurai applied to the action),
Collect $5 (per samurai),
Collect wood (up to four, with one samurai on the action and one in the forest for each wood you want), or
Build (up to two buildings, with two samurai on the card and one in the desired city, along with the required resources)

Each turn, the players simultaneously choose which actions they want to take with their three cards and in which order, programming those actions on their player cards, similar to the planning phase in Dirk Henn's Wallenstein and Shogun."
1661,"Players then take actions in turn order, moving samurai on the board as needed (paying $1 per space moved) in order to complete actions (to the forest for wood, the rice fields for rice, cities to build, and so on)."
1661,"Before a player can move samurai, however, he must use an action to place them on the game board; some actions allow free movement, and others allow a player to recruit additional samurai beyond the initial five."
1661,"One other action allows you to recruit additional action cards from an array on the side of the game board, thereby giving you four (or more) cards from which to choose for the rest of the game."
1661,"Building in cities costs resources and gives you points as well as money; as more players build in a city, the funds are split among all present, with those first in the city receiving a larger share."
1661,Players can also receive points or buy stone by dealing with a traveling merchant.
1661,"Once at least one player has twelve points, the game finishes at the end of the round, with players scoring endgame bonuses for money in hand and other things."
1661,The player with the most points wins.
1661,Edo includes separate game boards for 2-3 players and for 4 players.
1662,"With the fall of Napoleon, the British East India Company plied its trade unchecked from the Cape of Good Hope to the markets of Hong Kong."
1662,"India stood at the center of this sprawling imperial network, and the currents of empire ran through its ports, tying the Far East with European markets and awarding the British virtual control of the vast wealth of the subcontinent."
1662,"However, the ""crown jewel"" of the empire was far from secure."
1662,"Across the forests of Siberia and the steppes of Asia, the Russian Empire advanced at a rate exceeding even the pace of America's western pioneers."
1662,"This expansionism by the world’s largest nation loomed over British holdings in India, casting a longer shadow each year."

1668,"from GMT website:
More than thirteen years of design and development have gone into the making of Europe Engulfed (EE), which is GMT Games' first offering to the block-game enthusiast."
1668,It covers the entirety of World War II in Europe from September 1939 to the end of 1945.
1668,Europe Engulfed plays fast with its focus on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under.
1668,The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail.
1668,"The entire campaign is playable in a single 10-to-14 hour day once players become familiar with its elegant game systems including:
Wood Block Units:
Wood blocks for land units provide a realistic fog of war."
1668,"Only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong until combat is engaged."
1668,The inability to know the strength of your opponent ensures that even the most experienced players will make their fair share of tactical and strategic errors.
1668,"Production and Strategic Warfare:
Europe Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns."
1668,The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them.
1668,"Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose."
1668,"Special Actions:
Special actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns."
1668,"Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase."
1668,"Rulebook and Playbook:
The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples."
1668,Also included is a 24-page playbook.
1668,"The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play highlighting the May/June 1940 turn which reveals tactics for successfully attacking and defending."
1668,Europe Engulfed plays quickly with a very historical feel.
1668,Many players have indicated that they actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war.
1668,We know of no other European Theater of Operations game that plays this fast and with this much historical value.

1669,"Players may use these cards' special abilities, use the cards to vote for or against the issue under consideration, or to try and claim tokens in each of the four types of issues."
1669,"When a round ends, the issue either passes, or is flipped to its opposite side (Federalist/Anti or Big/Small)."

1670,Players either spend their turn reinforcing a village (adding more tokens there) or invading a neighboring village (expanding influence if you have more total tokens than the victim).
1670,"The unique twist is that, after each invasion, the connecting bridge is removed."
1670,"So over the course of the game, attack options become more and more limited, until the game naturally comes to a conclusion."

1672,The game has great replay value because it is not known whether a character with a specific ability will make their appearance on the board in the Day 1 or in the final Day 7.

1678,Egizia: Shifting Sands is an updated version of the beloved strategy game Egizia.
1678,"Players travel down the Nile, placing boats as they go, to collect resources that will help them construct some of Egypt's most famous monuments."
1678,"With new monuments to build, new cards to collect, and a constantly shifting river, Egizia: Shifting Sands Edition is a streamlined, modern update that both longtime fans and new players can easily pick up and enjoy."
1678,"In Egizia, players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards."
1678,"In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place their remaining pawns only on the squares below the one they just occupied."
1678,"When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players (which are separate from the pawns) must be fed with the grain produced in the fields."
1678,"The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn."
1678,"If a player doesn't have enough grain for all their workers, they must buy it with victory points."
1678,"After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do so was reserved earlier) along with the workers."

1678,"The more columns you build, the better powers you unlock to help you on the river."

1678,"With randomized rewards from game to game, the Colonnade is a dynamic new monument to shake up traditional gameplay."
1678,"Below the Colonnade, where the graves once stood, lie the mysterious statues — a new monument unlike anything else in Egizia."
1678,"These tiny build sites are cheaper than any other monument, but they hold the potential for high reward if you fulfill their requirements."
1678,"Players must plan early as they can place only one brick in a statue per round, and each level they build has more strenuous requirements for endgame bonuses."
1678,"Egizia: Shifting Sands keeps all the painstaking risk/reward decisions of the original Egizia and adds new depths of strategy, balance, and gameplay for a fresh twist on a timeless classic."
1679,"Anomia plays off the fact that our minds are positively brimming with all sorts of random information: things to eat, pop songs, websites, etc...

1685,"We decided on solitaire, because it had the proper feel."
1685,"Commanders have staff and advisors, but in the end, they alone make the hard decisions that affect lives, change the course of campaigns, and decide the fate of nations."
1685,"In this game, you make all the decisions needed to command your Forces."
1685,"The game rules, charts, and die rolls dictate the actions of the opposing forces."
1686,The election of the Aztec High Priest is imminent.
1686,"In order to prove their value and merit, the contenders engage in a race for prestige to win the favor of the gods."
1686,Will you be able to make the most beautiful sculptures of feathered snakes (called Cóatl) to stand out and gain access to the coveted title of High Priest?
1686,"In Cóatl, players work to build the most beautiful and valuable serpents."
1686,"The serpents, or Cóatl, are constructed with a head, a tail, and a number of body tiles, each made from chunky, colorful plastic."
1686,"On a turn, players will either take tiles from the central board to their personal board, or work to construct one of their Cóatls with the different tiles they've collected."
1686,The game end is triggered when one player finishes their third Cóatl.
1686,"Players receive points for fulfilling objectives, and the one with the most is named the new High Priest!"
1686,"•••
L’élection au titre de grand prêtre aztèque est imminente."
1686,"Afin de prouver leur valeur et leur mérite, les prétendants s’engagent dans une course au prestige pour conquérir la faveur des dieux."
1686,Saurez-vous réaliser les plus belles sculptures de serpents à plumes (appelés Cóatl) pour vous démarquer et ainsi accéder au titre tant convoité de grand prêtre aztèque?
1686,"Dans Cóatl, les joueurs construisent les plus beaux et précieux serpents à plumes qui soient."
1686,"Ces reptiles, appelés Cóatl par les Aztèques, sont construits d'une tête, une queue et un certain nombre de pièces de corps en plastique épais et coloré."
1686,"À tour de rôle, les joueurs prennent les pièces du plateau central et les transposent sur leur plateau personnel afin d'assembler stratégiquement des Cóatls en fonction des couleurs édictées par leurs cartes d'objectifs."
1686,La partie se termine lorsqu'un joueur complète son troisième Cóatl.
1686,Les joueurs reçoivent des points pour la réalisation d'objectifs et celui qui en a cumulé le plus est déclaré grand prêtre aztèque!
1686,"•••
In der aztekischen Mythologie ist der Schöpfergott Quetzalcoatl als Gott des Windes, des Himmels und der Erde allgegenwärtig."
1686,"Gefiederten Schlangen, Cóatl genannt, schmücken antike Tempelanlagen in ganz Mexiko."
1686,"Erschafft die aufwändigsten und elegantesten Skulpturen geflügelter Schlangen, auch Cóatl genannt, damit einer von euch zum neuen Hohepriester der Azteken ernannt wird.Während des Spiels erschafft ihr Cóatl, indem ihr Kopf-, Körper- und Schwanzsegmente verbindet, die den Voraussetzungen eurer Prophezeiungskarten entsprechen."
1686,"Je mehr der Voraussetzungen erfüllt werden, desto mehr Prestigepunkte bringt das fertige Cóatl."
1687,"In each opening round of the trick-taking card game Nyet!, players take turns crossing out possible choices for starting player, trump, super trump, the number of cards you discard, and the value of tricks taken on a grid, leaving only one option in each category."
1687,"Once the starting player is determined, that player chooses a partner, then the teams play out the round based on the conditions they collectively chose."
1688,The game is based on the traditional middle-eastern game of Okey.
1688,First created in the 1930s and sold in hand-produced versions until the late 1970s.
1688,"Similar to the Rummy that you play with cards - you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind."
1688,The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits.
1688,"This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com)."
1689,"Description from the designer:
Nautilion is a dice game in the Oniverse series!"
1689,Take the helm of a Nautilion submarine and recruit a heroic crew to vanquish the treacherous Darkhouse that lurks in the oceanic depths.
1689,"You must get to the Abyss, lair of the Darkhouse, before the Phantom Submarine (his henchman) reaches your homeland, the Happy Isles — but to defeat the Darkhouse, not only must you be faster than the Phantom Submarine, you must also assemble the submarine's crew along the way."
1689,"Each turn, you roll three dice and give one to each of these figures: the Nautilion, the Phantom Submarine, and the Darkhouse."
1689,The dice of the Nautilion and the Phantom Submarine move those figures along a path formed by Crew tokens: the Nautilion from the Happy Isles towards the Abyss; the Phantom Submarine in the opposite direction.
1689,"The crew token on which your Nautilion ends its move joins your submarine, the one the Phantom Submarine reaches is lost!"
1689,"Only four copies exist of each of the nine different tokens, so you have to decide carefully which die you need and which you can leave to your enemies."
1689,"(The Darkhouse doesn't move, but inflicts damage to you each time he gets a die with a high value.)"
1689,"To win, you need to reach the Abyss with a full crew of nine different tokens."
1689,"Five expansions are included with the game, adding new crew members, powers, treacheries and challenges."
1690,"Terramara is the name of the villages founded around 1500 B.C., mid- to late Bronze Age, in Northern Italy."
1690,"People lived, travelled, and traded between the Alps mountain range and the river Po."
1690,"The main occupations of the Terramara people were hunting, farming and metallurgy, casting bronze tools like axe heads in stone molds."
1690,"The houses in the villages were built on piles, meaning each house is built above the ground, supported by wooden stakes."
1690,"In Terramara, you play as the chief of a clan living in one of these villages."
1690,"Your goal is to develop your clan, exploring lands farther away to trade with other villages, and reach sacred places."
1690,You improve your battle strength and discover new technologies to create useful artefacts.
1690,The player who develops the best clan by gaining more development points becomes leader of all of Terramara and wins the game!

1691,Warhammer Underworlds: Nightvault is an action-packed combat game for two players.
1691,"Build your warband, construct your deck, and defeat your rivals."
1691,"Shadespire was once a city of wonder and magic, a mercantile metropolis whose rulers defied death, to the fury of Nagash."
1691,"During the height of the city’s powers, rivals, thieves and would-be conquerors were locked away in the sprawling dungeon known as the Nightvault."
1691,"After the city’s fall, Nagash broke open the chains that bound the shackled spirits within, giving them weapons to freeze the hearts of the living and enough memory of their torment to fill them with hatred and jealousy."
1691,"The spectral dead delight in the chance to inflict this hatred upon the living, and the streets of Shadespire echo to the sounds of terrifying screams and cruel, mocking laughter..."
1691,"The Game
In Warhammer Underworlds, you and your opponent pick a warband – 2 are included in this box – and build a deck of power and objective cards."
1691,"After placing your warband on the hex-tiled game boards, you take turns making actions – movement and attacks – until 3 phases are played."
1691,"Between actions, you can use the power cards to introduce effects and reactions that can swing the battle in your favour; building the best deck you can and using cunning to deploy these abilities at the perfect time is the secret to mastering the game and dominating your foe."
1691,"Merely vanquishing your opponent’s warband does not guarantee victory – capturing objectives, standing your ground, making the best tactical choices and deploying the right cards at the right time will gain you the glory points you need to win!"
1691,"Once you’re familiar with the rules, games will take around 30 minutes – you’ll always have time for a rematch."
1691,"In The Box
Everything you and a friend need to play games of Warhammer Underworlds is included in this box."
1691,"Contained within:

 A Stormcast Eternals warband – Stormsire’s Cursebreakers – made up of 3 push-fit, blue plastic miniatures (Rastus the Charmed, Ammis Dawnguard and the leader, Averon Stormsire);
 A Nighthaunt warband – the Thorns of the Briarqueen – made up of 7 push-fit, bone-coloured plastic miniatures (The Ever-Hanged, Varclav the Cruel, the leader Briar Queen and 4 Chainrasps whom Nagash has not afforded the dignity of names)."
1691,"Both of these warbands are Easy To Build, with no glue necessary and a comprehensive, easy to follow construction guide;
 A 32-page rulebook, including the story of Shadespire’s rise and fall, the opening of the Nightvault, the background of the 2 included warbands and all the rules you need to play – including new scatter mechanics, rules for resolving magic spells, and the use of lethal hexes, sections of game board that are fatal to those pushed in;
 An 8-page quick start guide, covering the contents of the box, understanding your cards, movement and attacks, and playing your first game;
 2 double-sided game boards, featuring hexes and objectives;
 2 pre-built decks of power and objective cards – 96 in total – for use with the included warbands;
 10 double-sided Fighter cards, providing the stats and information needed for the fighters in each warband at a glance;
 5 attack dice, 3 defence dice and 3 magic dice;
 11 double-sided objective tokens;
 A scatter template;
 30 wound tokens;
 46 double-sided glory point tokens;
 15 double-sided move and charge tokens;
 15 Guard tokens;
 8 activation counters."
1691,"Extra Rules
Warhammer Underworlds has an intense, fast and fun core ruleset, but the book contains a host of extras - new game modes, competitive and multiplayer rules:

 Matched Play: designed for competitive play, this is a set of rules that level the playing field to the finest degree – perfect for fast, friendly rivalries and tournaments;
 Multiplayer games: extra rules that allow you to combine 2 core sets of Warhammer Underworlds to create 3-or-4-player games, with clarified rules for resolving attacks and adjustments to victory conditions."
1691,"Also included is a glossary for quick and easy reference and a sample chapter of The Mirrored City, a Black Library novel set in Shadespire."

1692,The expansion of your navy and armies can take what should be rightfully yours.

1692,Mare Nostrum allows for up to 5 players and offers a basic and advanced game in which players can customise their starting civilisation.
1692,"For a game of such scope, it is quite amazing to think that the game only requires 2 pages of rules."

1693,Each unit has a movement rating in hexes.

1693,The master game uses a system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.
1693,"It's possible to bring a ""pre-fab"" army to the battle in order to save time."
1694,Cytosis: A Cell Building Game is a worker placement game that takes place inside a human cell.
1694,"Players start out with a number of workers and on a player’s turn, they will place one of their workers in any available location within that cell."
1694,"Some of the locations provide players with resources (e.g., mRNA, ATP); some with actions (e.g., convert resources, collect cards)."
1694,"Resources are used to build enzymes, hormones and/or receptors, which score Health Points."
1694,The player with the most Health Points at the end of the game wins!

1696,Players take turns diving into the water from the edges of the shore to collect the noctiluca dice from the board and keep them safely in jars until they can deliver them to healers.
1696,"After two rounds, players compare points from their successful deliveries and the player with the most points wins."

1699,"Carcassonne: Gold Rush is the second title in the ""Carcassonne: Around the World"" series of tile-laying games, with each game being based on the original Carcassonne design in which players slowly create a world by placing tiles on the playing area and scoring for various features in the landscape they create."
1699,"In Carcassonne: Gold Rush, players return to the 19th century in the United States when cowboys drove cattle, trappers traded with Native Americans, the first railway routes appeared, and explorers — that is, the players — sent their henchmen to gold mines to laboriously search for gold nuggets."
1699,"Depending on where you place your tent, you might be able to snatch a nugget from another explorer — but sometimes you'll be left holding fool's gold while someone else uncovers a rich gold find..."

1700,"–The Empire at War
Set amid the constant warfare of the Old World, Warhammer: Diskwars is a game of ferocious, fast-paced tabletop battles for two to four players."
1700,"At the heart of the game's conflicts are its disks, which represent heroes and units from across the Old World."
1700,"During the game, you activate these disks, flipping them end over end to move them across the battlefield, position them to attack, and interact with terrain and other disks it overlaps."
1700,"When one disk covers another disk, the disk on top is considered to be ""pinning"" the disk below it; this prevents the pinned disk from activating, and at the end of the round, overlapping disks must fight one another."
1700,"By maneuvering carefully to pin your opponent's units, you can strike them down, seize control of the battlefield, and win the day!"
1700,Warhammer: Diskwars has been updated to its new setting within the Warhammer world and features flexible rules for hero-centric army-building.

1703,Players may assign workers to action slots in the public region.
1703,There are usually 5-6 actions for each player to choose and these actions change between rounds.
1703,"By assigning workers, players carry out the actions' effects such as earning coins or paying coins for technologies, wonders, or victory points, etc."
1703,"At the end of a player's turn, workers may return to the player or disappear according to the kind of action it was working on."
1703,"In subsequent rounds, players MAY pick another civilization card to replace their previous one."

1705,Seeland plays in the golden era of the Netherlands (17th century).
1705,"In this time the province Seeland (Zeeland) gains ever more power, prosperity and significance."
1705,The object of the game is to expand and extract more land surface from the sea.
1705,Players live as a respected burgher in this time and take part in the land reclamation.
1705,"The game board shows 3 main sections - the scoring track around the edge, a rondel where you gather seed tiles and windmill tiles, and the land area where you place and/or reveal tiles for scoring."
1705,"Setup includes randomly placing ""island"" tiles on spaces designated in the land area."
1705,"At the beginning of the game, you place one of your 4 windmill pawns in the special starting area indicated in approximately the center of the land area."
1705,The rondel uses a unique method for determining which tiles are available in the inner ring of the market.
1705,"If you select a seed tile, (cabbage, rapeseed, or tulips) you must place it on an empty space adjacent to one of your windmill pawns."
1705,"If you choose a windmill tile, you place it on an empty space adjacent to a space already containing a tile."
1705,All tiles have a victory point number (some are zero).
1705,"When you surround a windmill, you total the adjacent tiles and score that amount on the track, if you have at least 2 types of seed amongst the adjacent tiles."
1705,"If all tiles are of the same type, no points are scored."
1705,"If all 3 types are present, add 5 points to the total."
1705,"If you place a windmill next to one or more island tiles, you flip them over to reveal their type."
1705,They may be seeds or a farm.
1705,"If you reveal a farm, you get a coin which can be used to take an immediate second turn."
1705,"When either the supply of windmill tiles or of seed tiles is exhausted, the game will soon end."
1705,(The exact end time depends on the movement within the rondel.)
1705,"If you are playing with the set of rules that allow for end game bonus points, score them, and the player with the most points wins."

1706,"The city of Caveborn will be the capital of the Five Realms, a place where all the races will learn to live together in harmony, with the main purpose being to bring them closer and prevent another war."
1706,The Queen needs to keep the alliance between the races and ensure that Caveborn is peaceful and prosperous.
1706,"To that end, a Settlers Council has been formed with Berk the Town Clerk as its chairman — but Berk is getting old and needs a successor."
1706,Are you that person?
1706,Rise to Nobility is a worker (dice) placement game set in the same fantasy world as Cavern Tavern.
1706,"You each own a small piece of land in the newly built city, and your job is to rise from anonymity, make your way to the title of lord, and take over the head seat at the Stone Council."
1706,"You can achieve this by upgrading your land and increasing its value, satisfying the demands of the settlers' council, attracting and housing as many settlers as you can, accommodating their needs, finding them jobs, and helping them develop from apprentices to guild masters, thus insuring you have people in high places all around the city of Caveborn."
1707,"The Sun is dying
In recent years, the Sun has become increasingly unstable, to the point where experts claim it could go supernova at any moment."
1707,"The various inhabitants of the planets in this solar system are launching one last effort to save themselves, which involves building a final Ark to propel a small selection of their people into deep space."
1707,"This requires a great deal of energy, and in a final ironic twist, the only source of such great energy is the dying star itself."
1707,"In the process of extracting and transmitting the energy required to save themselves, they will be compounding the instability of the Sun and hastening the end of their worlds."
1707,Sol: Last Days of a Star is a board game for one to five players where each player represents a different planetary effort to transmit as much energy from the Sun back to their Ark so they can to escape the solar system before the Sun explodes!
1707,"The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core)."
1707,"The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased."
1707,"Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment."
1707,You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations.
1707,"If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner."
1707,"You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape)."
1707,But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next.
1707,You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever.
1707,"With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!"

1710,Each of your actions will be judged during the weighing of your heart.
1710,"Pharaon is a game mixing resource management and worker placement into a single mechanism, thanks to its Wheel of Actions."
1710,"It is located at the center of the gameboard, surrounded by 5 areas, representing the 5 actions featured in the game."
1710,"Each round, the Wheel indicates which resource has to be spent for accessing the matching action."
1710,"As the wheel rotates from one segment by the end of each of the 5 rounds, this access cost to actions fluctuates throughout the game."
1710,"As a consequence, players have to plan their actions, anticipating which resources they may need for the next round."
1710,"But there are a limited amount of available spots on the wheel, forcing you to watch your opponents, which resources they have, and what they may intend."
1710,How to play ?
1710,"A game of Pharaon is played in 5 rounds, during which the players take turns one after the other, until everyone has passed."
1710,"On their turn, a player performs one of the 5 actions on the board."
1710,"The actions can provide Prestige Points (PP), determining who wins at the end of the game, but they can also help getting new resources for further turns."
1710,"To be allowed to perform an action, the player has to pay its Access cost, by spending the resource indicated by the Wheel of Actions for the area in which they want to act."
1710,They then pay the Action Cost by spending the corresponding resources.
1710,"The resource spent on the Wheel to access this area gets deducted from the Action Cost, if it can match."
1710,"So, it is useful to anticipate the rotation of the Wheel for taking the actions at their best cost."
1710,"But there is a limit on how many times an action can be performed, and your opponents may need the same as you."
1710,"Moreover, the game will be closely watched by the Gods."
1710,You will have to fulfill as many of their demands as possible to get their support and some extra PP.

1712,"On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit."
1712,"To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher."

1712,"If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards."

1712,"The Polish game Lato z Komarami features gameplay nearly identical to LLAMA except that the game has one less ""llama"" card, and the penalty for llama cards in hand is 10 points per card, instead of being 10 points for one or more llama cards."
1713,Race!
1713,"Formula 90 is a car-racing game simulating all the typical elements of a motor sport event: car strategies, weather changes, pit stops, tire management, overtaking, doubling, and of course damages and crashes."
1713,In Race!
1713,"every game turn represents one or more laps of the track, and each player is in control of only one car."
1713,"Other cars, called robots, move automatically on the track fighting between them and the human players."
1713,"Players are provided with a set of racing cards and a car chart to keep track of all available resources (tires, damages, reliability)."
1713,"By playing racing cards, they move along the track and in so doing they spend resources."
1713,"Movement can be affected by trajectories on the track, straight, corner and braking sections, opponents and other special events like yellow or blue flags."
1713,"Braking sections have a particular feature: here players and robots can try late braking, a dangerous maneuver that allows them to overtake multiple cars simultaneously."
1713,"Other maneuvers or cards require a ""check"", e.g., playing a card with a check value lower than a predefined target."
1713,Strategies and driving skills are another key element of the game.
1713,Players must exploit these unique capabilities to gain against competitors while adapting their driving style to the actual race conditions.
1713,"When using a strategy at his best, a player achieves a ""special"", which allows him to draw a track card, which is usually more powerful than ordinary racing cards."
1713,Race!

1713,Usually the winning player combines excellent management of his car together with a pinch of opportunism and bravery.

1714,"But there’s a trick: one cannot activate all their cards at once, which means that tough choices will have to be made each turn in order to select the cards that are the most needed."
1714,"The resources gathered from the activated city cards will allow the players to acquire cards from a common pool, allowing them to get improved buildings, technologies, wonders, etc."
1714,and therefore to leverage their civilization deck to new heights through more and more efficient card combos.
1714,"As the common pool of cards progresses (either as players have acquired cards or because they didn't - which leads to one card from the pool to be discarded per turn), the game progresses through eras."
1714,"Medieval cards are better than classical cards, and industrial cards are even better, but of course those cards are more and more expensive to acquire."
1714,"A modular board, at the center of the table, holds each civilization's army."
1714,The board is made of Provinces to be conquered.
1714,Unoccupied Province's inhabitants are barbarians who will provide resources to the player who defeats them.
1714,Holding a conquered province also brings victory points.

If a number is revealed, the player writes the number in one of that line's indicator boxes, then draws a ◯ in each box in the line starting with the closest empty box, stopping when they've reached the end of the line, reached an already filled-in space, or drawn the indicated number of ◯s."

1724,"All of these scenarios contain chapters, each with its own narration and specifics."
1724,The objective of the game is to progress through the tale and face the endgame at the finale of each scenario.

1724,The game scales by default; there is no need for special conditions based on the player count.

When it is your turn, place a worker on the board."
1725,"All the players place their workers, one at the time, until everybody has placed all their workers."
1725,"Then, in the order of the turn, the players trigger all their workers."
1725,"Think ahead, because some actions require other actions to be triggered beforehand!"
1725,"For example, if you want to get pelts, the ""Hunt"" action must have been triggered earlier in the turn."
1725,"And when you skin the game to get the pelts, then the meat becomes available for the other players."
1725,"It is crucial to remember the turn's order when you place your workers, or they might have nothing to do when you resolve your actions!"
1725,Another key point of the game is that the spots on the board are linked with each other.
1725,"Triggering 2 actions that are linked with each other gives you a boost (by improving those actions, or giving you extra resources, ...)."

1725,"You score points by:

 Building tents for your tribe
 Feeding your tribe
 Handcrafting objects
 Raising the highest Totem for the deities
 Showing generosity to your opponents


The player with the most points at the end is declared Nētā-Tanka!"

1726,"Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is."
1726,"Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target."
1726,"The game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games."
1726,B-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game.
1726,"The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely."
1726,"Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player)."

1728,"If someone reveals a location without any connection, that player is out of the round."
1728,The last remaining pirate grabs one of the valuable treasures.
1728,"Then, all revealed locations are turned face down before the search can start afresh."
1728,"As the cards do not change position during a game, players collect more and more information each round, enabling them to reveal new connections — but sometimes a little bit of luck is all it takes to get that treasure."
1728,"For advanced players, each animal comes with an additional special action that is triggered when a connected location is revealed — and they make Memoarrr!"
1728,even more exciting and fun to play.

1732,Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures.
1732,Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to his home space wins!

1734,"After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up."

1734,"Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play."

1735,The Bad: Carousing in a tavern isn't exactly the best way for Serena to stay on that righteous path...

1739,"Lastly, they supply their Shops in their Metropolis by stocking the remaining resources."

1746,"The game is played with magnetic playing pieces on two sides of a vertical board, so the Mummy player cannot see the pieces of the tomb raiders."

1748,"The Theme
In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered."
1748,The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West.
1748,The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.
1748,"Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean."
1748,"SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade."
1748,"The Game
Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states."
1748,"Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous."
1748,"In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities."
1748,The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities.
1748,"Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity."
1748,"In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available."
1748,"Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states."
1748,"Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered ""full""), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce)."
1748,"During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them."
1748,"For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control."
1748,"Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods."
1748,"Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful."
1748,But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money.
1748,"Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities."
1748,A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.
1748,The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players.
1748,Turn order is defined by bidding.
1748,"The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last."
1748,"Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting."
1748,"For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded."
1749,"Duel of Ages II is a time-scramble board game played between two opposing sides each having 1 to 4 players, with uneven size allowable."

1749,"Game play is an unusual mix of tactical wargame-style combat, treasure gathering, and non-combat character teamwork and adventuring, and has no close comparison to other games."
1749,"Differences between characters are significant, with many having poor fighting skills."
1749,"Game play and winning is therefore an act of balancing fighting, treasure-gathering and adventuring."
1749,"From the game box:
Select a team of characters."
1749,"Overcome adventures and the enemy team to win favor, achievements, and ultimate victory."
1749,"And while you are at it, enjoy the stories that your game builds."

1753,"At the start of a turn, the active player rolls nine dice, then places all the dice with the highest value on the gold space at the top of the chart, then starts placing dice from the bottom of the chart up, with each value of dice being on a separate level."
1753,"The active player takes all the dice on one level, then the action associated with that level."
1753,The top level gives the player as many gold as the number of dice they took; the bottom level gives goats instead of gold; and the middle levels allow a player to deliver goods to a number of market stalls on their personal player sheet equal to the dice claimed.
1753,"(You have four colors of market stalls, and once you start marking off, say, rugs in one of the blue areas, you have to finish marking off all the rugs in that area before you can start marking off another blue area.)"
1753,"The active player can spend gold to roll up to three extra yellow dice and thereby increase the odds of getting to take a desired level; if the active player doesn't take any of these yellow dice, they are removed from play, preventing others from benefitting at that player's expense."
1753,"Instead of marking off gold, goats, or goods, you can use the value of the die or dice claimed (1-6) to move the steward on your personal score sheet."
1753,"The steward starts in the middle of a 5x5 grid on your sheet, and you must move it as many spaces as the number of pips on the die value claimed, not crossing over any line you've drawn previously."
1753,"You can pay 1 gold to move the steward one more or one fewer space, and you can pay as much gold as you want to do this."
1753,"You can receive gold, goats, or goods from where the steward stops, but beyond that, you can earn points."
1753,"When the steward stops on a corner space of this grid, you count the number of spaces circled to this point, with some spaces counting twice, then you write down that number, scoring that many points at game's end."
1753,"If you stop in another corner later, you do the same thing again, which compounds the value of all your previous movement."
1753,"You can spend gold or goats to construct buildings that give you bonus powers, such as collecting two additional gold whenever you collect any gold or moving the steward up to two spaces more or less without paying."
1753,"After 16 turns (with four players) or 18 turns (with two or three players), the game ends and you tally points for goods delivered, spaces visited by the steward, buildings constructed, and goats and gold still on hand."
1754,Euchre is a trick taking card game.
1754,"Although for two to seven players, Euchre is best with four playing as partners."
1754,This is a relatively simple bidding and trick-taking game and one of the best non-threatening partnership games.
1754,"Conventional euchre uses a deck of 24 standard playing cards consisting of A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9 of each of the four suits."
1754,"A standard deck  52-card deck can be used, omitting the cards from 2 to 8,  Players are dealt a five-card hand and the object is to win three of the five tricks."
1754,"A card is turned up to determine trump, which can be either accepted or refused by each player in turn."
1754,"If refused, another bidding round takes place in which each player is given the privilege of naming trump."
1754,The player fixing trump has the option of playing alone or with partner.
1754,(Playing alone increases the scores and penalties.)
1755,"Relic is a board game in which two to four players each assume the role of a powerful hero from the Warhammer 40,000 universe and bravely venture forth to shield the Antian Sector from certain doom."
1755,"By completing missions and defeating enemies, characters compete to gain rewards and experience, furthering their chance of being the first to defeat whatever evil lies beyond the Warp rift."
1755,"Building on the foundations of the Talisman system, Relic is an adventure game in which seemingly straightforward choices mask scores of possibilities."
1755,"For those who haven't played the classic fantasy adventure game Talisman, this means that on each turn, a player rolls a single six-sided die before moving his playing piece that number of spaces clockwise or counter-clockwise around the region (outer, middle, or inner) of the board it currently occupies."
1755,"That player then draws a card or cards to see what he's encountered, pitting his heroic persona against foul enemies, dangerous locations, and fantastic strangers."
1755,"And all the while, these intrepid heroes rise in power, as they work their way toward the ultimate goal at the center of the board."
1755,—description from the publisher
1756,"Your goal in Top Ten is to survive five rounds, so you and your fellow players need to figure out how to get things in order!"
1756,"To start the game, place a number of unicorn tokens on the game board."
1756,Choose one player to be the round's chief.
1756,"That player gives all players a random card numbered 1-10, then they read one of the five hundred theme cards included in the game, e.g., ""Batman wants to replace Robin to fight the bad guys."
1756,"Create a new duo 'Batman and ...' from the worst to the best."""
1756,"The chief looks at their number, then gives an answer based on their number."
1756,"If they have a 1, they want to give the worst possible suggestion; if a 10, the best; if a 5-7, somewhere in the middle."
1756,"Each other player then gives an answer to this theme based on the number they were dealt, then the chief needs to decide who has the lowest number, then the next lowest, and so on."
1756,"For each mistake, the chief flips a unicorn token over to its poop side."
1756,"If all the unicorns have left by the end of the fifth round, leaving you with nothing but poop, then you lose."
1756,Otherwise you win!
1757,This game is played in several hands.
1757,In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards.
1757,Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards.
1757,"There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners."
1757,"This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others."
1757,The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals.
1757,Each is scared away only by certain other animals.
1757,"Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away."
1757,"Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog."

1758,"Bouncers - Bouncers are like guards from the original Burgle Bros, but with streamlined rules."
1758,"If they ever run out of cards in their patrol deck, look out!"
1758,At that point they hunt for the nearest player every turn.
1758,"Chips - Because you're infiltrating the casino in broad daylight, you're going to have to deal with more than just bouncers."
1758,"Unrevealed chips are scattered throughout each floor, representing people in the casino."
1758,"A Mole might give you info you need to crack the safe, and a Crowd might hide you from the bouncer."
1758,"But look out for a Saleswoman who will talk your ear off, trapping you in that tile!"
1758,"Finales - Once the safe is open, things get crazy."
1758,Finales add a game-changing twist in order to make it out of the casino with your hard-earned loot.
1758,Campaign Mode - Beat each finale in succession and get rewards!
1758,The game adapts its difficulty according to whether you win or lose.

1769,"Rommel in the Desert is a fast-moving, challenging, tense, and playable wargame based on the North Africa desert campaign of World War II."
1769,This game has been enjoyed by thousands of gamers for over 20 years.
1769,Experience the wargame many consider the best on the subject.
1769,Rommel in the Desert simulates the experience of command.
1769,The real problems of generals have nothing to do with shuffling combat factors to get a perfect 3-1 attack while the enemy waits passively to be overwhelmed.

(adapted from Columbia Games website)

Rommel in the Desert is a pre-""Front"" game touching on the conflict between the British and Germans in North Africa during WWII."
1769,"A game of maneuver, each side has to move with precision and know when to strike, since a cut in supply spells disaster for either side."
1769,The supply system is card driven.
1769,The game comes with a map of North Africa and 100 wooden blocks to represent the British and Germans.
1769,This title uses Columbia Games Block system.
1769,While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system.
1769,Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks.
1769,"This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a ""fog of war"" because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength."
1769,"Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number."
1769,Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength.
1769,"Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide."
1769,With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.

1770,Homas Tour is the original edition of the cycle racing game later known as Um Reifenbreite.
1770,Many copies of the original game were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1979.

1772,They just won't know it.
1772,"On top of that, Sherlock Holmes himself is already on the case."
1772,Can they solve the crime before he does?
1772,"At the start of Beyond Baker Street, players select one of the crimes to solve, and a number of suspects, motives, and opportunities will be available for the players to convict of the crime."
1772,"Each player holds a set of clues, but they won't be able to see their own clues — only those of their counterparts."
1772,"Each turn, a player must take exactly one of the following actions:

ASSIST another detective 
INVESTIGATE crime scene 
CONFIRM evidence 
ELIMINATE dead leads 
PURSUE new leads

Players win together if they can gather enough evidence to make a conviction before Holmes does; otherwise, they crumble under the stress of the case."

In the Horus Heresy board game, the most legendary battle in the history of the Warhammer 40,000 universe unfolds across the razed plains of Terra and in the frozen orbit above."
1773,"Deadly fighting ranges from the Emperor’s golden Inner Palace to Horus’s flagship, the Vengeful Spirit."
1773,"Taking the side of traitor or loyalist, two players control either fearless Space Marine legions or deviant Chaos Space Marines, mighty Titans, Imperial Armies both loyal and traitorous, and a fearsome array of other units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves."
1773,An innovative order and initiative system forces each side to carefully consider the commands they issue to their troops.
1773,"A dramatic, card-driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos."
1773,This legendary tale of treachery and heroism is brought to vibrant life with over one hundred magnificent sculpted plastic playing pieces.

1773,"Once the board is set up with playing pieces and terrain for your first game, it will be a wonder to behold."
1773,Horus Heresy includes six scenarios that differ in both difficulty and style.
1773,"The first scenario, titled Brother Against Brother, is recommended for all new players as it provides predetermined starting locations for both player's forces."
1773,"It is a well balanced version of the Battle for Terra, and also presents a roughly historical recreation of the conflict's events."
1773,"Horus Heresy is a board game that pits two players against each other to recreate the most famous battle of Warhammer 40,000’s rich history, in which the Warmaster Horus’s betrayal of the Emperor comes to its climax."

1773,"Brother fights brother, and the universe hangs in the balance!"
1773,"Not to be confused with Horus Heresy (1993), the original 1993 Games Workshop game of the same name."
1774,"Compounded is a game about building chemical compounds through careful management of elements, a fair bit of social play and trading, and just a bit of luck."
1774,"In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others – or destroyed in an explosion."
1774,Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.
1774,"Although Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates."
1774,"Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools, and even favors – if there is truly honor among chemists!"

1776,"Citrus provides players with new challenges, and little is left to chance."
1776,"The moves are simple, but the decisions are tricky."

1803,"Sorcerer: A Strategy Card Game is set in what the company describes as a grim, gaslamp lit world full of fantastic, mythical creatures and sorcery."
1803,"Designed for two to four players, the game pits two ancient beings of great power against one another to determine which of their lineage are strongest."
1803,"The players use sorcery to conjure minions, cast spells, and wield enchanted items to reach the game's goal of conquering three battlefields."
1803,"The game uses a simple resource system of ""energy"" that is determined randomly by a dice-roll at the beginning of each round, to make sure no round is the same."
1803,"However, the outcome being the same for both players, the game balance stays even."
1803,"This energy is then used in the Action Phase for conjuring minions from your hand on any of three battlefields, casting possessions that can improve your minion's traits and abilities; or sorcery cards with various direct effects."
1803,"Also as an action you can add more energy to your Energy Pool, draw more cards, move minions to another battlefield etc."
1803,"The choice is yours, it is just about your pure skill to handle the battle preparation!"
1803,"In the Battle Phase players roll amount of custom dice equal to each minion's attack trait with possible outcome of miss, hit, double hit or critical hit for each die, and place damage counters on the respective minions or directly to the Battlefield."
1803,"A unique system of Omen tokens then allows to adjust this outcome by re-rolling the dice, before distributing the damage among opponent's minions and battlefield."
1803,"The combination of usual mechanics like story driven deck building, push your luck or dice-rolling; and a unique system of influencing the outcome of the battle, provides a perfect balance between strategy and random elements (even you still have the possibility to influence the outcome)."
1803,Dividing the round to the Action Phase and Battle Phase then creates a very pleasant and natural flow of the hardcore game play.
1803,"Sorcerer was first developed in 2012, and in 2014, Peter Scholtz consulted with Czech and Slovak board gaming communities intensively to fine tune the mechanics of the game."
1803,"In August 2014, the first “Print and Play” demo version of Sorcerer was published, responding to all the remarks and feedback Peter Scholtz received, allowing him to create both his upgraded, native language demo and finally the, English language version of Sorcerer."
1803,The Sorcerer prototype was available for the wide audience as a free to play testing material over the year 2014.

December 16, 1944
After a period of fog, rain, and snow blankets the area, three German armies unleash 26 divisions against thinly held American lines in the Ardennes forest of Belgium and Luxembourg."
1806,"The objective of the Germans is to push through the Ardennes, then cross the Meuse River and head for Antwerp."
1806,Hitler hopes to split the Allied armies apart and smash their vital supply port at Antwerp.
1806,Can the Americans stop them?
1806,"Historically, the German army trampled the American VIII Corps and penetrated within two miles of the Meuse."
1806,The Americans stubbornly fought the Germans at many critical crossroads slowing and then stopping Germany's elite forces.
1806,"Historically, the German offensive achieved little except to create a ""bulge"" in the American line."
1806,Ardennes '44 explores this fascinating campaign with a detailed order of battle and an extremely accurate Ardennes game map which covers the area from the Our River to the Meuse.
1806,Ardennes '44 covers the period from December 16th to the 26th.
1806,Two shorter one-map scenarios are included which cover the initial stages of the German attack.
1806,"The Ardennes '44 game system is designed by Mark Simonitch, winner of the CSR James F. Dunnigan Award for Design Elegance and Best WWII Board Game of 2000 for Ukraine '43."
1806,"The result is Ardennes '44, a game that both the ""Bulge enthusiast"" and the casual player will enjoy."
1806,"German attacks follow historical advance routes, and the Bastogne and St. Vith defense perimeters are often as large as they were historically (instead of one big stack of units in the town itself)."
1806,The Allied player has a chance at holding Elsenborn Ridge and making the Germans pay dearly for the twin villages of Rockerath and Krinkelt.
1806,"Likewise, the German player has an equal chance of changing history and reaching the Meuse River."
1806,"TIME SCALE: 12 hours per turn

Spring 1941: Nazi Germany is triumphant."
1807,Poland has long since vanished from the map.
1807,"Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun."
1807,"France, the victor of 1918, has fallen."
1807,Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed.
1807,"Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy."
1807,"But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps."
1807,"Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union."
1807,"As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide."
1807,But the course of History has just taken a major turn.
1807,The Last European War is over; World War II has begun.
1807,"It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin."
1807,"World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich."
1807,"Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe."
1807,"As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa."
1807,"Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months."
1807,"The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45."
1807,"As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players)."
1807,"Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event."
1807,"Events include:

Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) 
Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) 
Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) 
Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) 
Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) 
Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) 
Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)

World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs."
1807,"And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game."
1807,The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.
1807,"It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin?"
1807,"As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours."
1808,Wings of War: Watch Your Back!
1808,is the second title in the WoW line and is again set in World War I.
1808,The game can be played by itself or mixed with Wings of War: Famous Aces for larger scenarios.
1808,"It includes 5 models of planes: the Nieuport 11, Hanriot HD.1 and Halberstadt D.III fighters, together with the British/American DH4 and the Austrian Ufag C.I two-seaters."
1808,"There are also 4 decks of movement cards, 1 deck of combat cards, rulers, counters and a promo card for the first set depicting an American SPAD XIII."
1808,"The rulebook is the same as Wings of War: Famous Aces and it lists scenarios for each of the two boxes, plus a couple for players who own both of them."
1808,18 airplane cards are for immediate use.
1808,"A curious plane, useful for more variated scenarios, is the Nieuport 11 of the German Jasta 1, flown in action by Leutnant Gustav Leffers."
1808,"In the box there are also a few weapon variants for owners of ""Famous aces"": Scaroni's and Fucini's HD.1 with twin machineguns instead of the single one that was the standard from the factory; a British DH4 with a twin machinegun in the rear arc; a DH4 of the American Expeditionary Force with twin machineguns both on the forward and on the rear arc."
1809,"Impulse is a quick-playing 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) game set in space with the game board being composed of cards that have actions on them."
1809,"Players also have cards in hand, and in addition to featuring one of ten possible actions, these cards have a color (red, yellow, blue or green) and a size (1, 2 or 3, as indicated by the number of icons on the card)."
1809,"Each card also has six edges, and these edges connect adjacent cards in the hex-shaped playing area."
1809,"The cards in the playing area start face down, with each player controlling a card(their Home) on a corner of this area."
1809,Each player has two transport ships in the center of his Home card and a cruiser on an edge.
1809,"Cruisers are used to patrol sectors of space and destroy opposing transports, while transports let you activate sectors that you enter."
1809,"On a turn, a player adds a card to the Impulse from his hand, then (optionally) performs an action for a tech in his playing area, then (optionally) performs all the actions in the Impulse, then draws two cards and adds them to his hand."
1809,The Impulse is a line of cards shared by all players that changes turn by turn as players add cards to it and as cards fall off once it reaches maximum size.
1809,"Thus, players need to feed the Impulse with actions that benefit them more than opponents, but that's easier said than done."
1809,When you perform actions – whether from moving transports to them or using the Impulse – you can boost them by having minerals of the same color or lots of transports.
1809,"Each action has a single numeral on it, e.g., ""Command [1] ship for one jump"" or ""Build [1] cruiser at home""; when you boost an action, you increase that numeral."
1809,"Players score points by destroying enemy ships (one point per ship), by controlling edge spaces on the central card (one point per edge), and by taking other actions via cards."
1809,The first player to score 20 points wins!

1812,"As in classic zombie movies, a shambling horde is invading the city."
1812,The goal is to survive the assault.
1812,"(Un)fortunately, surviving often means sacrificing some of your fellow players to the undead...
Each player controls several characters with different abilities; these characters can move to various limited-capacity locations, which they can then barricade and scavenge for items and weapons."
1812,"Critical situations, such as zombies breaking in and eating a character, are resolved using a vote."
1812,"The basic game mechanisms are the same as in Mall of Horror (also designed by Nicolas Normandon), but City of Horror differs in both materials and game play in a number of ways: the city map changes each game, twenty characters are included, they can use antidotes (or die), action cards become scarce as the game goes on, you can gain points with stuff other than surviving characters..."

1814,"The game has card Assets -- including such things as snipers, artillery, air support or demolitions -- but is not card-driven."
1814,It is also not the typical Igo-Yougo fare with a strict sequence of play.

1849,Razzia!
1849,is a card game re-implementation of Knizia's earlier board game Ra with the only notable changes being the re-theme and lack of catastrophes.
1849,This time players are mafiosi bidding for the booty stolen the previous night.
1849,"Cars, jewels, and even whole nightclubs are for sale!"
1849,"Each round, players will take turns flipping over booty cards to see what is available for auction in this lot."
1849,"Once a lot contains enough desirable items (or when a policeman card is revealed), players bid on the displayed items using the available cheques."
1849,"The round ends when all the cheques have been spent, or when enough policemen arrive to raid the building and put an end to the illegal auction."
1849,"Players then score points according to what cards they have accumulated - some cards are discarded after scoring, while others remain in that player's collection for the following rounds."
1849,Whoever has the highest score after the third round is declared the winner.
1850,Ticket to Ride: First Journey takes the gameplay of the Ticket to Ride series and scales it down for a younger audience.
1850,"In general, players collect train cards, claim routes on the map, and try to connect the cities shown on their tickets."
1850,"In more detail, the game board shows a map of the United States with certain cities being connected by colored paths."
1850,"Each player starts with four colored train cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two cities, and you're trying to connect those two cities with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket."
1850,"On a turn, you either draw two train cards from the deck or discard train cards to claim a route between two cities; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long)."
1850,"If you connect the two cities shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket."
1850,"(If you can't connect cities on either ticket because the paths are blocked, you can take your entire turn to discard those tickets and draw two new ones.)"
1850,"If you connect one of the West Coast cities to one of the East Coast cities with a path of your trains, you immediately claim a Coast-to-Coast ticket."
1850,The first player to complete six tickets wins!
1850,"Alternatively, if someone has placed all twenty of their trains on the game board, then whoever has completed the most tickets wins!"
1850,Part of Ticket to Ride series.
1851,"You are buying artwork for your museum, always trying to meet the current trends and finding genuine art from your associates."
1851,But the famous Belratti is trying to cheat his own fake paintings into your collection.
1851,"In Belratti, players are split into two roles — buyers and painters — and are playing against the game."
1851,The game presents two cards as topics for which the buyers need to buy paintings.
1851,"They ask for a certain number of cards, and the painters have to collectively meet this target number."
1851,The painters select cards from their hands they think will fit the most to one of the topics.
1851,Then additional cards are added as Belratti's fakes.
1851,"All cards are shuffled upside down, then flipped up."
1851,"The buyers then have to select all the cards from the painters, not the fake cards by Belratti."
1851,The roles change after each round.
1851,"If too many fakes are bought, the players lose."
1852,"For several decades during the Viking age, parts of England were occupied by the Norsemen."
1852,"Under their influence, one of the larger cities turned into a flourishing center of trade and craftsmanship."
1852,"The Vikings called the city and its surrounding kingdom ""Jórvík"", which is today known as the city of York."
1852,"In the game Jórvík, players assume the roles of Viking jarls."
1852,"They gather prestige points by trading goods, holding big feasts, funding pillages, commissioning craftsmen and hiring soldiers to defend the city against recurring invasions."
1852,The player with the most prestige points wins.
1852,The game is a re-design of Die Speicherstadt (2010).
1852,"In this game, players acquire cards from a card display through a simple yet brilliant worker placement and bidding mechanism to build up their trading empires."
1852,"Jórvík includes two versions: A base game that is equivalent to Die Speicherstadt, and an advanced game that equates to Die Speicherstadt including its expansion Kaispeicher."
1853,"Keltis is a multi-player game based on Lost Cities, with some rules changes, later published with Knizia's original rules and theme as Lost Cities: The Board Game."
1853,Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths.
1853,"Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each)."
1853,"In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order."
1853,"As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones."
1853,"The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path."
1853,"Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points."
1853,The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths.
1853,"Now, scoring happens: 

 Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2)."
1853,"Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10)."
1853,"One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative."
1853,"Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points."
1853,All endgame points are added to any scored during the game.
1853,The player with the highest score wins!
1853,"Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:
1."
1853,"In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect."
1853,(Normal scoring occurs each round.)
1853,"In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round."
1853,"This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected."
1853,2.
1853,"In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high."
1853,"In LCBG, you must go low to high."
1853,"Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above."
1853,Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.
1853,There are more differences that are non-substantive.
1853,"(Art, points in LCBG multiplied by 5, etc.)"
1854,"Amidst the frozen ruins of an ancient city, wizards battle in the hopes of discovering the treasures of a fallen empire."
1854,"In the fantasy skirmish wargame Frostgrave, each player takes on the role of a wizard from one of ten schools of magic, and builds his band of followers."
1854,"The wizard's apprentice usually accompanies his master, and more than a dozen other henchman types are available for hire, from lowly thugs to heavily armored knights and stealthy thieves."
1854,Wizards can expand their magical knowledge by unlocking ancient secrets and may learn up to 80 different spells.
1854,"While individual games of Frostgrave are quick and can easily be played in an hour or two, it is by connecting them into an ongoing campaign that players will find the most enjoyment."
1854,The scenarios given in the book are merely the beginning of the limitless adventures that can be found amidst the ruins of the Frozen City.
1854,Osprey Games and North Star miniatures will produce a full range of official Frostgrave miniatures.
1854,"This includes wizards and apprentices from all ten schools of magic, and all the soldiers that can be hired for their warbands."
1854,"The wizards, apprentices and specialist henchmen such as the apothecary and thief are metal sculpts while a multi-part plastic box set offers huge variety in building the more common soldier types."
1855,"In Florenza, the players are the heads of the most powerful families in Florenza during the Renaissance period."
1855,The goal of the game is to become the most famous patron of the arts by hiring the most famous artists of the period and financing their works.
1855,"Each player can commission artworks in his own district, the Cathedral, or in the civic buildings of the city."
1855,Each artwork requires money and resources to complete.
1855,"To earn the money and resources the artists need, the players send their workers to labor in various workshops, possibly even in their opponents’ districts."
1855,Additional workers can be earned by offering charity to the church.
1855,"During the game, players will earn prestige points, primarily by completing artworks."
1855,"Prestige points can be spent during the game, but at the end of the game they will be the player’s primary source of victory points."
1855,All of the characters in the game are real historical figures that lived and worked in Italy during the Renaissance.
1855,Most of them worked in Florence.
1855,All of the buildings in the game were real Renaissance workshops.
1855,The artworks the players can complete include the masterpieces of some of the most famous artists in the world.
1855,"Note from the designers directly from the rulebook:
""We apologize if we included some characters in the game who never worked in Florence during the Renaissance, but we wanted to include all of the most important artists (in our opinion) from that golden age of Italian art and culture."
1855,"Michelangelo, for example, left an important mark on the history of the city—and the Renaissance period—even if he was only in Florence for a short time."
1855,We also added some portraits of military leaders (created by Ivan Zoni) to the rulebook.
1855,"They are not involved in the game, but they were influential members of public life during this era."
1855,"The names of the buildings, parts of the Cathedral, and the workshops are in the literal form they had in Italy during the 1400-1600 period."
1855,"Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects."
1855,"We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn’t know."
1855,"We hope you agree with our choice, and we hope you have a good time playing Florenza!"""
1856,"Starting with a limited amount of resources and workers, you set out to run your lumber mill as efficiently as possible."
1856,Savvy investments and proper planning will ensure that your mill will be the most profitable.
1856,"Be cautious, however, for competition is fierce!"
1856,"You will need to secure the best cutting areas, make use of limited contract workers, and continually update and replace your equipment."
1856,Your competitors are not the only thing to worry about as you will also need to store enough firewood and food to survive the harsh winters.
1856,Lignum is a strategic optimization game that portrays the logging industry in the 19th century.
1856,"Each round, players travel to the nearby forest, picking up tools and hiring workers along the way."
1856,"After felling timber, players must decide how to transport their wood to their sawmills and if the wood should be processed or sold immediately, all the while optimizing their entire processing chain."
1856,"The second edition of Lignum also includes the ""Joinery & Buildings"" expansion."
1856,"In this expansion, players can visit two additional locations along the supply path."
1856,"Players may now acquire special buildings that give them unique, special abilities for the remainder of the game."
1856,"Additionally, players can acquire joiners to help generate more income each round; if those joiners are supplied with the appropriate wood, players can earn extra money at the end of the game!"
1857,Players explore the ruins of Castle Dragonfire trying to reach the treasure chamber in the center of the dungeon and escape alive with as much treasure as possible.
1857,A limited number of turns before the game ends puts pressure on players to take risks and score rewards because anyone left in the dungeon when time runs out dies!
1857,A tile-laying system creates the maze-like dungeon and ensures that no two games are ever exactly the same.
1857,"Originally published as Drakborgen (Dragon Keep) in 1985 by Alga, a subsidiary of BRIO AB."
1857,Sold in Norway (Skatten i borgen) and Denmark (Drageborgen).
1857,"Licenced to Germany (Schmidt Spiele) as Drachenhort, to Great Britain (Games Workshop) as DungeonQuest."

1859,"In Dragonwood, you collect sets of adventurer cards to earn dice, which you then use to roll against your foes."

1859,Choose your strategy carefully because the landscape of Dragonwood is ever-changing.
1859,Only the bravest will overcome the odds to emerge victorious!
1859,"Gameplay:
On their turn, players either draw a card or attempt to capture a creature or enhancement."
1859,Players draw from the Adventurer deck that contains cards of 5 different colors all numbered 1-12.
1859,"With these cards players form combinations to attempt a Strike (cards in a row of any color), a Stomp (cards of the same number) or a Scream (cards of the same color)."
1859,"To capture, players roll a number of dice equal to the number of cards they have of the particular combination."
1859,"Each creature has different minimum values of a Strike, Stomp or Scream needed to capture it, and a Victory Point amount."
1859,"The game includes six, six-sided dice with sides 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and 4 to reduce extremely lucky outcomes."
1859,"The Dragonwood deck has 42 cards, 5 of which are displayed in the landscape at any time."
1859,"In addition to creatures, this deck also has enhancements that are captured in the same way as creatures which assist players in capturing creatures, and contains events that also impact play."
1859,"When both dragons have been defeated, the game is over and the player with the most victory points wins!"
1859,Is the best strategy to go for several smaller creatures or save up for larger attacks?
1859,"Should you grab some enhancements hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for creatures?"
1859,Do you take chances on some rolls or go for sure things?
1859,"Every time you play Dragonwood the deck is different, so no two games are the same!"
1860,"Game description from the publisher:
Sails of Glory is a series of games that recreates naval combat in the Age of Sails (1650-1815)."
1860,"Based on the game system used in Wings of Glory (formerly Wings of War), Sails of Glory uses miniatures, cards and board game mechanisms, with a special deck of maneuver cards representing the different movement capabilities of each vessel."
1860,The game will be supported by a range of painted and assembled 1/1000 miniatures.
1860,"Players will choose their maneuver cards in secret, then reveal them all at the same moment."
1860,"The card features arrows to be put in front of the miniature, then the latter is moved on top of the arrowhead."
1860,"Several options on the same card are available depending on the wind and, with advanced rules, the sails used."
1860,"After all ships moved, guns are fired from the sides of the miniature to targets in range."
1860,The Wings of Glory game system has been modified and expanded to accurately represent battles at sea between the large sailing ships of the past centuries.
1860,The first series of Sails of Glory will be set in the Napoleonic Age.

1861,"It features 4 separate armies and 7 unique starting kingdoms, each with its own strengths and abilities, plus Kings Orders cards that play an important role in strategy."
1861,"User summary:
The goal of the game is to be the first player to control 7 crowns."
1861,Each city under a player's control provides a crown and a mission card deck gives an opportunity to earn more crowns.
1861,"While there's some similarities to other versions of Risk, the turns are quite different."
1861,Each player has a deck of orders they can take on their turn.
1861,"They secretly place two orders face down, and the first place starts by revealing an order."
1861,"One order card type is to either tax a player's connected territories to gain income or to spend that income on siege weapons, archers, cavalry, infantry units, castles or crown cards."
1861,The other order card type is to expand a player's units into another territory or move units from one territory they own into another.

1861,Battles for contested territories are fought with dice.
1861,Non-infantry units are rolled for first by type and deal immediate damage after which all units roll with 3 dice for the attacker and 2 for the defender.
1861,"Diplomacy, alliances, and backstabbing are inevitable."
1862,Jump on board the good ship Tranquility and set sail for paradise.
1862,"Take care, though, because in a land where the day blends into night it's easy to lose track of time and you still need to find that special little island to call home."

1864,"In a distant land, many and many years ago, rose a big and wealthy city: its name, now forgotten by most, was Hermagor."
1864,"Commerce was the source of its richness, because from all its territory countrymen, artisans and also adventurers brought to the city every kind of merchandise: weapons, ancient books, precious relics, and rare dragon eggs."
1864,"In this city, you can buy and exchange everything."
1864,This made Hermagor famous and merchants came from afar to buy and sell all kinds of goods at the market.
1864,Some even undertook perilous adventures to acquire especially rare items.
1864,"They criss-crossed this wealthy region, creating new paths and roads, adding markets to towns, but always with the aim to become the richest!"
1864,"Set in the imaginary land of Hermagor, each player takes on the role of a merchant striving to be the wealthiest trader."
1864,"While playing, they aim to acquire goods in the marketplace and then sell those goods profitably in the towns and villages across land of Hermagor."
1864,Players first gain access to goods tiles in the marketplace by placing their agents in proximity to the tiles they want.
1864,"Then the players move one agent across the map of Hermagor, visiting and selling goods in the towns requesting goods that match the tiles the player acquired in the marketplace."
1864,Hermagor is played in five rounds with two phases in each round.
1864,Each round begins with the marketplace phase.
1864,Players pay to place their four agents in the market trying to control the goods tiles they will use in the second phase of the round.
1864,Control of a tile goes to the player who has the most agents next to the tile.
1864,Ties are broken by the priority of the adjacent locations.
1864,Agents adjacent to the sides of a tile take priority over agents adjacent to the corner of tiles.
1864,An agent placed on a tile has the highest priority.
1864,"After all agents have been placed and tiles claimed by the players, the marketplace agents also generate income."
1864,"Agents in the same row or column generate income at the rate of 1 for 1 agent, 3 for 2 agents, 6 for 3 agents, and 10 for 4 agents."
1864,The price for placing agents depends on the location.
1864,Locations that apply control to more tiles cost more.
1864,Each round concludes with selling phase.
1864,"Players take turns moving one agent across the map of Hermagor, paying a price for each road segment they use so that they can sell goods in a town or village."
1864,"Importantly, each player may only sell in any town or village once during the game."
1864,Players mark each town or village where they have sold goods with a house.
1864,Players receive a small monetary reward when other players sell in a town or village that the player has already sold in.
1864,"Selling goods in all the towns or villages surrounding a region of the map defined by a set of roads potentially gives the player the right to a production facility in that region, supplying additional income immediately and at the end of the game."
1864,Hermagor ends when the last player finishes his turn of the selling phase of the fifth round.
1864,"End game bonus money is awarded for production facilities, most sales along the major road, and for the smallest of each players sales locations in each of the three Hermagor regions defined by its rivers."
1864,The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.
1865,A world of beautiful colors comes alive in Pastiche as players choose commission cards picturing 34 of the finest European art works of the past six centuries.
1865,Players score their commissions by mixing primary colors through clever tile placement and recreating the palette of colors used by the masters who created these works.
1865,"Explore the paintings, palettes, and pasts of the artists in this unique and challenging game for the whole family."
1865,"While placing hexagonal pieces to gain palette (color) cards, players become familiar with the different color combinations that produce the many hues of an artist’s palette, all listed on the Player Reference Card."
1865,Players also learn to recognize many great artists and their works as they complete commissions.
1865,"An ""International Edition"" of Pastiche was released in late 2011."
1866,"Alea Iacta Est is Latin for ""The Die is Cast""."
1866,Players take on the role of Caesar and compete for the most prestige points.
1866,"This happens by clever placement of his/her eight dice, which are placed on five different buildings."
1866,"At the Castrum (barracks), new provinces can  be conquered,  while patricians can be recruited at the Forum Romanum to be sent to those provinces."
1866,"At the Senatus, cards can be won for bonuses that will be kept secret until the end of the game."
1866,The Templum awards prestige points directly from the Goddess Fortuna.
1866,"Each die that does not win any of these ends the round at the Latrina, where it provides its owner with a “repete!” chip, which can be used to re-roll dice or can be traded in two-to-one for prestige points at the end of the game."
1866,"Each building has special rules as to how the dice can be placed, allowing many tactical possibilities with any roll of the dice."
1866,"Each round ends when one player has placed his/her last die, and after 5 rounds (6 rounds with 2-3 players), the patricians are organized in their provinces, the senate cards are revealed, and the scores are totaled."
1866,The player with the most prestige points wins!
1867,This trick-taking game is a standard deck playing card game and takes on many different group-specific rules.
1867,"Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table."
1867,"Each player bids the number of tricks he'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid."
1867,"The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit."
1867,"If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points."
1867,"Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal."
1867,Call Break is a popular variation of Spades among card game players in South Asian countries.
1867,"To win, players must score the maximum points in 5 rounds."
1867,Points equal the number of tricks bid in each hand.
1867,"The player who wins that hand gains point, the loser loses the same amount of points."
1868,Dominations: Road to Civilization is a 2–4 player game by Olivier Melison and Eric Dubus.
1868,"In this domino-based civilization building game, players take on the role of a primitive tribe, which they will seek to grow into a nation whose influence will echo through the ages...
Place your triangular dominos carefully to expand your population and obtain the knowledge that will determine how your society is shaped over time."

1891,e.g.
1891,If a player leads with three 4s then the next player must play three of a kind of equal or higher value.
1891,"When all players pass, the last player to have played cards leads a new trick with whatever card or set of equal cards they want."
1891,"Go out of cards first for first place, second for second, etc."
1891,"However, you also have advancements you can sleeve onto your cards."
1891,"These may increase or decrease the value of the cards, or even add new abilities such as turning a card into a wild or reversing the direction of the values (i.e."
1891,"you are now playing lower numbers instead of higher) or making cards count as multiple copies of themselves, etc."
1891,"But since all of the cards are reshuffled and dealt to start a new round, the changes you made may end up with someone else (and vice versa), and the common distribution of values will begin to change and shift over multiple hands."
1891,"Thus, a good strategy must factor in not just doing well in the current hand, but also managing your resources (card advancements) over multiple hands and maximizing their impact though well timed plays."
1891,You earn points and more advancements based on your end of round position.
1891,"Be the first player to go out each round and gain the most points, but draw fewer new advancements for the next hand."
1891,"To win a player must first get to 10 points, and then win a hand."

-If you are lower in the points you get cards on your turn regardless of what you roll."

1893,This is a nice touch.
1893,No matter how unlucky you are you still get something.
1893,"Plus if a player rolls a seven, the person can take a card from any other player, but their opponents now draw a random card from the deck."
1893,"- Market Trades: Since you have no roads you no longer need ports so, since you no longer have ports you can trade with the market for any resource on your turn; provided you have the right cards."
1893,"Additionally the ratios aren't bad, Any resource for 3:1, i.e."
1893,three of one for one of any other type.
1893,Goods (a type of resource) trades for 2:1.
1893,This plus no road blocking allows you to trade for resources and keep playing.
1893,"- There are NPC races that can give you benefits, some of which are +1 resources whenever you get a resource of the same type."
1893,But you have to get there early.
1893,"Now there is a new dynamic to the game, going out into space becomes a strategy on its own."
1893,- Negotiated trades: Since the resources are more readily available there are less negotiated trades.
1893,"They still exist and someone can still trade 1:1, 3:1, etc... but it is no longer a singularly driving force in the game."
1893,Unless you have a big move and you're missing that one card.
1893,- Resource (set collection) becomes part of your strategy without being limited to negotiation and luck of the die.
1893,I think this actually works better.
1893,Colonization: You colonize to claim planets in a system.
1893,This is the same as building towns in Catan.
1893,But how many can be in a system (hex) depends on player count.
1893,In a three player game you're only allowed two colonies per system.
1893,In a four player game each system only holds up to three players colonies.
1893,"If you got blocked out early from the closest systems, reach further into the stars to other systems."
1893,"Who knows you might meet pirate and you'll have to fight, or traders, perhaps a race of Travelers who will open a worm hole to anywhere on the map."
1894,"A clever repackaging of the parlor game Dictionary, Balderdash contains several cards with real words nobody has heard of."
1894,"After one of those words has been read aloud, players try to come up with definitions that at least sound plausible, because points are later awarded for every opposing player who guessed that your definition was the correct one."
1894,"Versions of the game as a parlor game go back at least as far as 1970, although Balderdash itself was not published until 1984."
1894,Mattel republished Balderdash in 2006 in a form that derives its gameplay from the sequel Beyond Balderdash.
1894,"Re-implemented by:

Beyond Balderdash / Absolute Balderdash
Kokkelimonke Jubileum

Re-implements:

Beyond Balderdash*


In a peculiar situation, this game was reimplemented by Beyond/Absolute Balderdash and then combined back into the original title (Balderdash) but with the rules and cards from Beyond/Absolute; while Tactic re-published their version of Beyond/Absolute combined with the original Balderdash and called it Kokkelimonke Jubileum."

1895,"Their main goal is to establish a broad and secure trading network to deliver the tea to the farthest provinces, doing it better than their opponents."
1895,"The main work behind the scenes is done in Pu'er, their home location: New traders need to be trained, better horses need to be acquired, and a good number of border passes need to be requested to be able to reach the farthest provinces."
1895,"Mere trading is not enough to beat the competition, however."
1895,Great social influence and a prestigious tea house may come in handy to propitiate the province inspector.
1895,"Bridges provide shortcuts, and trading posts in faraway places secure one's own path along the Tea-Horse Road."
1895,Yunnan is well-suited for players who like tactical development games.
1895,"Due to the interleaving game mechanisms, the players are involved at all times."

1896,Each player is one of these brave explorers who joined the expedition with old maps giving clues on where some of these treasures can be found.
1896,"However, it is clear that the land is barely known and dangerous, so, all explorers decide to travel together, in one solid group by hiring beasts of burden and exotic items in the native villages while trying to avoid the many dangers of the inhospitable land of Isla Dorada..."
1896,"Which one of these brave explorers will find the most valuable treasures, avoid the numerous curses and accomplish it's rewarding destiny?"
1896,"In Isla Dorada, players will have to move a unique pawn portraying the expedition of explorers."
1896,"Each player will collect cards of different kinds (movements, actions, destinations, curses, destinies, bonus or malus cards) and will have to build the best hands turn after turn (time is limited to a certain number of game turns) to be able to chose the expedition destinations in a succession of bids and negotiations."
1896,"Doing so, the players will try to put their hands on treasures while avoiding their cursed destinations and trying to block other player's objectives."
1896,The very easy rules can be learned in a few minutes whilst the rich and elegant game play assure an always renewed experience.

1899,Each deck has a different symbol on the back to aid with card sorting between rounds.
1899,"At the start of each round, each player lays out three cards face up in front of her to create her post piles; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to her post piles to create her blitz pile ; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down."

1904,The other player(s) form the revolutionary side.
1904,"They collect cards and fighters for two reasons: to resolve events for boosts to their side, and to fight off militia, snipers, and Soviet tanks in a drastic fight for survival."
1904,"They have to manage their positions while spreading across Budapest, carefully dividing their actions as a team and always keeping an eye on their morale lest they run out of cards."

1905,"However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own..."
1905,"While many similar games rely on a player to control the machinations of the dungeon, in DungeonQuest the dungeon essentially runs itself."
1905,"No one at the table knows what lies around the corner, creating a new play experience every time."

1913,"Set in the legendary city of Ragusa (now Dubrovnik), Ragusa charges players with the task of building the city in the 15th century, constructing its great towers, boosting trade with the East, and finding their fortunes."
1913,"Players build houses on the spaces between three hexes, gaining access to resources (on rural spaces) and actions (in the city), which means that a house effectively functions as a worker being placed, but triggering three spots at a time."
1913,"Players use resources gained in the countryside to build buildings, trade, and craft valuable commodities — the value of which varies as ships come and go from the harbor."
1913,"In the city, players gain access to actions, with each spot representing the three actions that surround it."
1913,"This simple worker placement gives way to a deep engine-building mechanism as not only will building around production spaces utilize the houses you've already built in the countryside, but building near other player's houses will re-activate them, giving other players valuable opportunities outside of their turns."
1913,The game ends once players have placed all their houses.
1913,The player with the most points from all sources wins.
1914,"Description from the publisher:
The new version of D-Day Dice, published by Word Forge Games, sees new art, missions, tiles and dice."
1914,"It is fully compatible with the previous version, but adds new mechanics and play concepts to the highly successful D-Day Dice franchise."
1914,"Normandy, June 6th, 1944 – as you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies."
1914,You must do something!
1914,"In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organize improvised units for an attack against the machine gun nest."
1914,Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else.
1914,"As the game progresses, he will collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier."
1914,He will succeed...or die trying.
1914,"D-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive."
1914,It also includes solitaire optional rules.
1914,"Although built around dice rolling, this game is about resource management (soldiers, specialists, items and courage) and knowing when to move your unit."
1914,"Resources are kept from turn to turn, so the players can plan ahead."
1915,"Il Vecchio is set in the 15th century, when Cosimo de Medici – also called ""Il Vecchio"" (""the Elder) – and his family ruled over Tuscany and its capital Florence."
1915,The players represent the heads of Florentine families trying to rise their families to power.
1915,"To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers (knights, assassins, abbots) and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action."
1915,"Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game."
1915,"To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met."
1915,That's why it is so important to have one's family members in the right place at the right time – to save on time and money while achieving one's goals.
1915,"At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany."
1915,Players take turns performing exactly one action.
1915,"Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location."
1915,"The available actions are to:

Take a location-specific action in Tuscany."
1915,This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing (active) family members at that location.
1915,"After the action, this family member is laid down (inactive)."
1915,"Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money."
1915,Travel to Florence where you'll spend scrolls (and possibly money) to claim a city council or nobility tile.
1915,Introduce a new family member to the board.
1915,Raise all lying family members on the board.
1915,"The game ends when the ""Power of the Medici"" has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles."
1915,"Certain actions require you to remove such a tile, and the game ends when they're all gone."
1915,"Players then sum their power points – earned for gained tiles and majorities in the regions and Florence – for a final scoring, and the player with the most power wins."
1916,Subbuteo is a classic finger-flicking football-simulation action game.
1916,"It is played on a large cloth playing field called a ""pitch"", with teams of miniature football players mounted on smooth round bases."
1916,"The football players are made to kick the ball by flicking their bases, which causes them to slide around on the pitch, hitting the ball."
1916,"The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks."
1916,There is even a large section in the rules devoted to fouling.
1916,"Far more popular in European countries than in the United States, this game allows collectors to buy teams of football players representing dozens of teams and countries from around the world, along with soccer stadium enhancements such as stands filled with cheering fans, referees that stand on the sidelines, even stadium lights."
1917,Tanto Cuore is a Japanese deck-building card game which has a mechanism similar to Dominion.
1917,Each player plays as the Lord of a mansion and hires maids to fill out their house to become the King of Maids!
1917,"The end goal is simple enough, the player who has the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins!"
1917,"Players acquire Victory Points by employing a variety of maids and ""Love"" cards that allow for different strategies."
1917,You can even employ Private Maids that stick around to use their special powers each per turn!
1917,"Some give you a bonus, or affect your opponents in a negative way."
1917,"But beware, your opponents can make your maids sick or give them bad habits, affecting your maids in negative ways and decreasing your Victory Points!"
1917,The game art is in the Japanese anime style and uses the theme of maids commonly seen in anime!
1917,"All of the cards, dividers and manual fit into an easy to transport box so you can easily take the game with you wherever you want."
1918,"Escaping from the zombie-overrun town of Woodinvale, a handful of survivors make their way up into the mountains – but as they reach the small logging and mining town of Timber Peak, they discover that a new nightmare has just begun!"
1918,Last Night on Earth: Timber Peak is an action-packed standalone game as well as an expansion for Last Night on Earth.
1918,"Introducing the brand new town of Timber Peak with a full set of game boards, six new Heroes (including three Survivor versions of Heroes from the original Last Night on Earth), four Generator objective pieces, a full set of 14 Zombies, a host of new Scenarios, rules for fire breaking out and spreading, over 130 new game cards, and a full Experience System for both Heroes and the Zombie horde to gain upgrades within the course of each game!"
1918,"Timber Peak is packed with new material for veteran players to add to their toolbox, and a fantastic way for new players to jump into the action."
1918,"A modular board randomly determines the layout of the town at the start of each game and there are several different scenarios to play, adding lots of replayability."
1918,"As with the original game, one or two players control the zombies, while the rest control heroes."
1918,"To achieve a horror movie feel, all of the art for the game is photographic."
1919,"In City of Iron, 2-4 players compete to build up a small nation in a world of machines, magic, and money."
1919,"Become the leader of one of four rival nations: the industrious humans, the toad engineers, the scholarly Cresarians, or the clever hogmen."
1919,"Produce goods like machine parts and bottled demons to gain wealth, or research steam-age technology and recruit mercenaries to control the continent."
1919,"If you want to establish new cities, you’ll build schooners or airships to reach faraway lands and flying islands."
1919,"Your cities have limited capacity, so you’ll have to decide what to keep and what to demolish when building advanced structures."
1919,The future of a nation is in your hands.
1919,Build unbreakable foundations for an empire or disappear into the dusty pages of history.
1919,"Differences from the first edition:

 The expert cards have some new iconography and have been rebalanced
 The expansion town card deck is gone
 The auction for player order has been simplified
 The pay track for going later in the turn is gone
 A bonus coin replaced the pirates
 The timing of scoring rounds has been changed
 Players now have different end-game scoring goals depending on their contract cards and regions, rather than everyone competing for the same set of end-game bonuses"
1920,"It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures!"
1920,Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles.
1920,There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand.
1920,"One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is."
1920,"""The 9-8-7,"" for example."
1920,Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7.
1920,This is repeated until the boards are filled.
1920,The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board.
1920,Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line.
1920,"A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle."
1920,"Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed."
1920,But that's as far as the comparison goes.
1920,Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.

1921,"Using the currency (coins) generated by your ""Rural"" territory cards, you incorporate cards from the market into your deck according to your own strategy."
1921,Each player's main goal is to give the princess he's fielded the throne.
1921,"First, collect stronger territory cards such as ""City"" and ""Metropolis"" to increase your coins, and declare fielding a princess using these coins."
1921,"There are five princesses and one set of twin princesses, totaling six princess cards."
1921,"Each princess has special support abilities, but with only one of each, you need to be quick to field the right princess and get the support you need!"
1921,"For your princess to take the throne, you must collect Succession Points, which represent the support of your loyal subjects and influential figures in the empire."
1921,"Once you control 20 Succession Points, you may declare a coronation."

1922,"At the end of the game, the crown is handed to the clan with most victory points, which are gained by amassing glory, reputation, gold, and trophies from defeating monsters."
1922,"The most important factor is glory; to gain it you must leave the safety of the Citadel and undertake missions, defeat or capture monsters, and conquer lands."
1922,"Your mercenaries provide you with dice, which you will use to take actions using a “worker-placement” mechanic."
1922,"In the Citadel, your dice allow you to improve your clan, acquiring hunting tools, shields, potions, venoms, mercenaries, and more."

1927,"In Nuns on the Run, most of the players are novices who are eager to secretly explore the grand abbey at night in order to fulfill their “secret wish.” They sneak through corridors searching for keys and treasures."
1927,(What treasures could a novice be searching for?
1927,Forbidden cookies?
1927,A soft mattress?

Game Overview:
Urban Sprawl is a game for 2–4 players."
1928,Urban Sprawl abstractly models the growth of a town into a teeming metropolis.
1928,"Players assume the roles of entrepreneur, tycoon, and politician—each helping in the development of a hypothetical ""Anywhere, USA."""
1928,Wealth and Prestige will be earned and spent throughout the game.
1928,Buildings will rise only to later be demolished for better and larger fare.
1928,Throughout the game players will gather valuable Permits.
1928,These will result in either a wealthy Investment or the foundation of a new building Contract.
1928,Players will strive to become dominant in one or more building Zones in order to acquire beneficial political offices.
1928,All of this eventually leads to the end game—a vibrant metropolis that is revered around the world—when the player with the most Prestige will be crowned the winner.
1928,"Game Play:
The grid of streets on the board provides the framework for building the small town."
1928,The buildings will be placed within the grid and identified with control markers (wooden cubes) to show each player's contribution to the growing urban area.
1928,Each building's value is determined by the cumulative Wealth and Prestige values of the block in which is it constructed.
1928,"At the start of a player's turn he may discard one or more Building Permit cards from hand as ""Investments,"" gaining Wealth in doing so."
1928,"Next that player gets 6 ""Action Points"" (APs) with which to spend on any of the the following activities:
• Acquiring new Building Permit cards from those available to choose;
• Constructing new buildings from those currently available;
• Acquiring a ""Favor""—a Building Contract that only that player can build."
1928,"Each activity carries with it a variable cost in APs, depending on where the chosen card lies on the board."
1928,Once a player has spent his APs it's time for a quick reset phase in readiness for the next player's turn.
1928,"It is during this phase that events can occur, elections can be held for the various political offices, and players receive payouts in Wealth and Prestige."
1928,Wealth payouts provide funding for new buildings while Prestige payouts provide victory points.
1928,"Generally, players will be trying to build in areas that provide better payouts."
1928,"Players are also looking to construct more buildings of a particular ""zone""—Government, Residential, Industrial, or Commercial—in order to help them win an election, as the politicians each confer a special ability to the player holding the office."
1928,"Many of the buildings also provide a one-time bonus as they are built, and players can benefit from construction in the right neighborhoods."
1928,"Throughout the game, the values of the buildings will generally increase as the town grows into a city and then a large metropolis."
1928,Neighborhoods that were once valuable can become run down and new city centers spring up as the urban areas sprawl out across the grid.
1928,"When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each Prestige row, earn points based on accumulated Wealth, and score bonus points for political offices held—after which the player with the highest Prestige total wins the game."

1932,"Each player in turn must beat the combination, with a pair being beaten by a higher pair or a triple."

1962,"To win, you must gain the most points by cleverly supplying ships and by adding the best businesses to your island."
1962,"Your turn in Juicy Fruits works like this: First, you slide one of your fruit collector tokens a number of unblocked spaces and collect that many fruits of the token's type: banana, orange, lime, pomegranate, or mangosteen."
1962,Then you may either fulfill the order of a ship on your shores or claim a business from a shared display and place it onto your island (or do nothing).
1962,"Clever planning and timing is vital because until you supply the ships on your shores, they block valuable island space which could be used to collect more fruit — but if you concentrate too much on the ships, the most promising businesses may get snatched by your opponents."

1962,"With each play, Juicy Fruits poses new puzzles of how to move your tokens efficiently and how to balance clearing your island with claiming businesses."

1963,Players are divided into managers and investors.
1963,Your goal is to earn more money than any other manager (if you are a manager) or more money than any other investor (if you are a investor) by the end of the fifth round.
1963,"Each round managers and investors negotiate with each other in a noisy, two-minute free-for-all to set a purchase price for shares in the managers' companies."
1963,"Investors then collect income from the shares they purchased but not until a roll of the dice brings (sometimes drastic) changes to the economy, with major consequences for the balance sheet of each player."
1963,"Managers collect what they are owed from investors, pay fees for each of their companies, and buy new companies at auction."
1963,"After five rounds of play (5 months), the manager and the investor who have accumulated the most money are each declared victors, the undisputed masters of commerce."

1964,"Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker."

1964,"You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have."
1964,You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!
1964,"Each of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players."
1965,"In Circus Flohcati, players collect acts from the flea circus to score points, with the game containing ten types (colors) of acts, with acts being valued from 0-7 points."

1965,"Otherwise, you again face the same options: Collect a face-up card or reveal a new card."
1965,"If on your turn you have three cards of the same value in hand, you can play this trio on the table for a guaranteed 10 points."
1965,The game ends either when someone reveals that they have all ten acts in hand or when the deck has been exhausted.

1965,Whoever has the highest score wins.
1965,"Editions of Circus Flohcati bear a player count of either 2-5 or 3-5, but they don't differ in the rules or nature of the components."

Nightfall - a new fast, furious and fun deck-building game from Alderac Entertainment Group."
1988,"Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own."
1988,"Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom."
1988,"During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area."
1988,The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.
1988,"After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play."
1988,"The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic, which was partially developed with the help of people right here on BoardGameGeek."
1988,Each card has a main color and two linking colors.
1988,"If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together."
1988,"Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn."
1988,"Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out."
1988,"Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents."
1988,The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents’ decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck.
1988,"But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!"
1988,"Nightfall's base set releases with starting decks of 12 cards for up to 5 players, and 24 distinct cards (7 copies of each) for drafting during play."
1988,"The box contains card dividers, and is in the same format as the much heralded Wrath of the Elements box for Thunderstone."
1988,"Integrates with:

Nightfall: Martial Law
Nightfall: Blood Country
Nightfall: The Coldest War
Nightfall: Dark Rages
Nightfall: Eastern Skies"

1990,"It features 6 games in 1; a campaign game of 24 turns which runs from the invasion of Poland to Germany's final defeat or victory, an advanced game providing additional complexity, a multi-player version (in which even the Italian player can be the winner), and three 12-turn scenarios which allow you to play faster games."
1990,Third Reich is not for the faint of heart or the beginner simulation gamer.
1990,For 2 to 6 players.

1990,"This game is a favorite of many because of an excellent balance between politics and military might, and it gives players a chance to try things that did not happen historically to see if they might have worked better (e.g., Germany invading Spain)."
1990,This game is definitely not for the novice gamer.
1990,"The rules are intricate, and there are many factors for players to deal with: resources, unit production, negotiation, and, of course, strategic warfare."
1990,Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10
1991,"In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard."
1991,"Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses."
1991,But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.
1991,"This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces."
1991,Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow & Righter and manufactured by Cadaco.
1991,Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood.
1991,The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.
1992,Mythotopia is a deck-building game set in a medieval fantasy world that draws on the mechanisms found in A Few Acres of Snow with players customizing their personal card decks by drafting cards and expanding into provinces.
1992,"The game board is composed of forty provinces, each with its own card."
1992,"At the start of play, you receive a number of Province cards at random, then mark your initial positions with town pieces."
1992,"Shuffle these Province cards with a set of five Initial cards to form your starting deck, then draw a hand of five cards."
1992,"The game includes 27 Improvement cards, 16 of which are drawn and placed on display; these cards will be drafted during the game."
1992,"Mythotopia has nine variable victory point (VP) cards, four of which are drawn at random for a game; place these cards on display with three fixed VP cards, then place a number of VP counters on each card."
1992,"The fixed VP cards give points for building cities, roads and castles, while the variable ones may change the board situation by adding dragons, runestones and citadels."
1992,"Alternatively they may grant VPs for controlling a certain number of sea areas, for successfully attacking other players, and for building cities/roads."
1992,"As these VP cards vary from game to game, they alter the balance between developmental and aggressive play."
1992,"On your turn, perform two actions, then refill your hand to five cards."
1992,"Nine actions are possible, such as buying armies or ships (after starting with six armies and two ships), placing these armies or ships, drafting Improvement cards (for a cost of one gold), placing cards in reserve (to use them on a future turn), permanently removing cards from your deck, using a card for its specific action, and invading a neighboring province."
1992,"To invade, you must play the Province card from which you attack as well as military cards and food; invading must be the first of your two actions, so if you're placing armies to prepare for an attack, opponents have the chance to prepare defenses."
1992,"Three resources are used in Mythotopia: food to feed invading armies, stone to build cities, roads and castles, and gold to buy armies, ships and Improvement cards."
1992,"Most provinces contain one resource type, and gaining that province gives you that resource."
1992,"You can turn towns into cities, which increases the number of cards you can keep in your reserve."
1992,"You can connect provinces with roads, which allows you to substitute one card for another on the same network in addition to moving armies freely between those provinces."
1992,Castles increase the defensive value of a province.
1992,"All of these constructions (cities, roads, castles) give you victory points, as does taking control of a province."
1992,"Additional points are available via the VP cards, with you taking VP counters when you meet the condition on a card."
1992,"For example, building a road gives you two VPs, but if the ""Roadside Inns"" VP card is in play, then you can expend an extra gold to gain an additional VP."
1992,"You can lose VPs if you lose control of a province, but you never lose VP counters."
1992,"The game ends after four of the seven VP cards have been emptied, and the player with the most VPs wins."
1993,Mage Wars Academy features gameplay similar to Mage Wars Arena (née Mage Wars) with two mages in head-to-head combat to see who will be victorious.
1993,"Mage Wars Academy is a two-player starter set that features two mages, two spellbooks, and a new ""boardless"" gameplay design that's more portable and fast-playing than Mage Wars Arena."

1994,Players take on the role of police officers with different areas of expertise.
1994,The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.
1994,"Complicating matters is the fact that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover."
1994,Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder.
1994,The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character’s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character’s rating for the current “search”.
1994,"There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched."
1994,These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations.
1994,"So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all… or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found."
1994,Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.
1994,At the end of each player’s turn they draw an event card.
1994,These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city.
1994,"Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don't stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime!"
1994,These Event cards are placed on the game board at the locations where they occur.
1994,"Some of them have “unknown circumstance” tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension."
1994,"If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed."
1994,Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.
1994,"So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies."
1994,"Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token."
1994,These tokens can later be used to help with tasks.
1994,"However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances."
1994,"The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for."
1994,"If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game."
1994,"To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation."
1994,"If time runs out, once again the murderer shall escape justice!"
1994,The pressure is great and the stakes are high!
1995,"It is the start of the bleak, desolate Antarctic winter when a group of NSF researchers manning the claustrophobic, isolated U.S. Outpost 31 comes into contact with a hostile extraterrestrial lifeform."
1995,"Bent on assimilating Earth's native species, this being infiltrates the facility — creating a perfect imitation of one of the Outpost 31 crew."
1995,"The staff frantically begin a sweep of the base, desperate to purge this alien infection before escaping to warn McMurdo Station that somewhere, out there in the frigid darkness, something horrible is waiting."
1995,"In the hidden identity game The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31, you will relive John Carpenter's sci-fi cult classic in a race to discover who among the team has been infected by this heinous lifeform."
1995,Play as one of twelve characters as you lead a series of investigations through the facility using supplies and equipment to clear the building.
1995,The tension mounts and paranoia ensues as you question who you can trust in the ultimate race to save humanity!
1996,"Horse Fever transports players to a setting based on the noir novels of the 1930s, where each player is called on to impersonate rich bettors that will use any means necessary to cause the bets they place to pay off."
1996,"They will fix races, bribe bookmakers, make horses fall asleep, buy stables and borrow money from the Mob in order to gain victory for their bets."
1996,"Horse Fever has three different game modes: Board Game, Family Game and Party Game."
1996,These three different modes enable each kind of player to have a good time.
1996,The Board Game will enable expert players to discover a game based on an endless number of strategies; the Family Game will enable little players and families to get to know the basic game dynamics while playing a simpler but yet just as fun game; the Party Game will transform Horse Fever into a platform for a potentially endless number of players and turn any boring party into the most entertaining event of the century.
1997,"In Ta Yü, a game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges."
1997,"On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board."
1997,Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.
1997,"First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points)."
1997,"Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers."
1997,"So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero."
1997,"Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices."
1997,"Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile."
1998,Crypt is a small-box set collection game with a unique dice placement mechanic for 1 to 4 players.
1998,"Place your servant dice on treasure cards, choosing any value on each die."
1998,"Choosing a higher value can ward off your opponents, but it also increases the odds that your servant will become exhausted."
1998,"After everyone has placed their servant dice, everyone rolls."
1998,"If you roll less than your chosen value, you lose the die."
1998,Sets of treasure can be pawned off to collectors that offer bonus coins and special abilities.
1998,The player with the most valuable collection wins!
